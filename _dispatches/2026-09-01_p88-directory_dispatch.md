CANON-PREAMBLE v6f9d139b
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY (OPS-19, `F-` rows) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker; `25_atom_architecture_reference.md` is superseded for the model): four layers, five canonicalisation stages, each stage the executor of its `BP-` rules; own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store, console Smart Site Factory in `hauska-map/apps/factory`; staging Smart Site under the Factory base URL and every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`). **OPTION A ruled** (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): P-82-lite plus BP-WRITE-01 land on the existing writer as a bug fix; Bexar 48029 cad finishes on the current shape (660,000 of 703,257 done); NO new county is written on the old shape; Harris, Dallas and the Texas remainder wait for the conformant stage E writer (F-15, F-16, F-18). STATUS 2026-08-27: Phase A closed; F-02 runner `factory-atoms-cad` (us-east4, digest-pinned, run row first) is the only writer job; OLD-SHAPE WRITES ENDED permanently (no `--apply` through the old writer for any county; Bexar 703,257 = roll, complete); the store is still the old shape and still serves; next card is the conformant writer (F-16 resolution, F-17 reconcile, F-20 stage-and-merge write, F-18 intensional demotion) on one Texas source, F-15 types from the substrate seat by request, then F-10 drains Texas, then F-06 publishes. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — template Dashboards UI first, then one adapter/source onto `template-city`. Live Bastrop is an island, not the next card. Three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU. Feeds are adapters that write records. Destination still `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_then_bastrop_onboarding.md`. Next-card sequence `_decisions/2026-08-17_dashboards_ui_then_one_feed.md`. Gap map `_inbox/2026-08-17_dashboards_missing_pieces.md`.
- FEED ADAPTER CONTRACT (G-63 CLOSED) — kinds are a catalog; grants are per city pack. Write spine or files with provenance. Never a Dashboards vendor table. Never Pipedrive as a city feed. Samsara fleet copies are not G-24. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g63_feed_adapter_contract.md`.
- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant. Identified caller is a Hauska product key whose `jurisdiction_tenant` equals `cityKey`. `DASHBOARDS_API_KEY` is not a tenant. Fixture pack `fixture-city`. Not sprint-54 done. Not live ingest.

- G-45 SMARTSITE STAFF MAP (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards staff map is the SmartSite embed of gold `48021:34137`. GET `/` auto-loads it. Do not cut live Leaflet. Do not clone PE.

- G-64 LANE C STAFF PATH (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards development-services mounts plan-review-app. GET `/?lens=development-services` auto-loads it. GET `/` stays G-45 SmartSite.

- COMPASS IS SHARED-ELEMENT SHEET CHROME — G-66 item. Top-bar source control, not a page, not a rail-only assistant. Answer engine is out of this wave. Old Compass is not the atom-render reference; SmartSite is. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_ux_implementation_sequence.md`.
- UX IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (G-67 first) — kit copy, then G-66 / G-68 / G-69 in parallel. Those three CLOSED 2026-08-17. G-24 stays zero. Live Bastrop no-touch.
- FILES COMPOSE THEN ONE FEED (G-70 G-71 G-72 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Work → Files mounts smart-files-app. G-71 wrote Bastrop municode meetings onto `template-city` files. That host is a HOLD (identity collapse), not a feed win. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_files_compose_then_one_feed.md`.
- SHELL BEFORE FEEDS (G-73 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Every G-18 / live-Bastrop staff function has a named home on the Dashboards shell. Connections is 67 of 67 Homes-table rows. Assets honest-empty. Feeds still pause. Register `_inbox/2026-08-17_g18_shell_homes.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_shell_before_feeds.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g73_shell_homes_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g73_close.json`.
- TEMPLATE-CITY IDENTITY (G-74 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — municode grant pulled off template-city. Compose meetings empty with basis `no municode calendar grant on template-city`. Citizen has no Chestnut. Connections HTML has zero Bastrop. No clerk retarget. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_template_city_identity.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g74_identity_leak_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g74_close.json`.
- DEMO-CITY CHROME (G-75 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — mounts fill the frame, one SmartSite iframe, Compass-class map motion from current rails, 30c screens honest-empty. Serving `00013-vkl`. Plan Review `embed=1` is Dashboards-side; host already had detection. Interruptibility partial. Register 67 of 67 plus 3 addenda. Note `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion.md`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v1890f0bb — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# P-88 the vendor directory listing

Date: 2026-09-01  Status: open, unassigned

## Why this is worth a row when it looks like marketing

Claude Sync is the only genuinely differentiated channel Smart Site has. Every other channel in the go-to-market plan is one a competitor can also buy. Today the connector is a reason to buy and a reason to stay, and it is not a way to be found, because discovery of an MCP connector happens through the vendor directory and Smart Site is not in one.

That makes this the highest-leverage unassigned item on the board. It is also the cheapest of the Wave 4 items, and unlike the rest of that wave it does not wait on revenue.

## The precondition that already cleared

A-035 ruled that vendor directory listings happen **only after a live Claude Connect probe**. That gate existed because listing a connector that does not connect is worse than not listing. P-87 has since shipped and been walked live, so the probe condition is satisfiable now rather than hypothetical. Item 1 below re-proves it rather than citing the ruling, because the ruling is a date and the connector is a running service.

## Done looks like

A person who has never heard of Smart Site can find it from inside a directory listing, connect it, and reach a first useful answer without reading anything we wrote about ourselves. The listing describes only capabilities the connector actually has today.

## Acceptance items

1. **Re-prove the connect path live, from a cold client.** A connection made from a client that has never held our credentials, reaching a first successful tool call. Report the tool, the parcel, and the response. A connection made from a warmed client or an already-authorised session does not satisfy this. | check: a dated artifact carrying the cold-connect transcript | grade: [ ]

2. **The listing claims only what the connector serves.** Every capability sentence in the listing maps to a tool that is live and reachable at the tier the listing implies. The three not-ready tools stay out, as they already do in the capability disclosure. A listing that names a capability the product cannot deliver is the same defect class as the marketing card that promised screens. | check: a table mapping each listing claim to a live tool and its gate | grade: [ ]

3. **Tier honesty in the listing.** The connector is available at every rung including Free and mirrors the workbench gates rather than carrying its own, per the connector ruling. The listing must not imply the connector is a paid feature, and must not imply everything inside it is free. Where a capability needs a paid rung, the listing says so in the same words the product uses. | check: the copy read against `_smartsite_masters/` positioning, which wins any conflict | grade: [ ]

4. **The claims come from the masters, never from this card.** `_smartsite_masters/` governs what may be said. Any sentence in the listing that is not traceable to a master gets removed or routed for a ruling, not written fresh here. | check: per-sentence provenance | grade: [ ]

5. **Submitted, and the submission recorded.** Directory, submission date, the exact text submitted, and the review state. If a directory rejects or holds the listing, that is the finding and it gets recorded rather than retried silently. | check: the close carries the submitted text verbatim and the response | grade: [ ]

6. **A check that fails when the listing goes stale.** The listing will drift from the tool set the first time a tool is added, renamed, or gated. Name the mechanism that catches that, and if the honest answer is that no mechanism exists, say so in the close rather than implying the listing maintains itself. A listing nobody re-reads is a claim nobody re-checks. | check: name the executor, the trigger, and what fails | grade: [ ]

## Explicitly not this card

Do not build a GPT store listing, SEO parcel pages, or a Zapier integration; A-035 named all three as not carded. Do not add or rename any MCP tool to make the listing read better. Do not change the connector's gates; the connector inherits the tier and does not carry its own. Do not write new positioning claims.

## Leave behind

Declared at close per the contract, `none` being a valid answer.
