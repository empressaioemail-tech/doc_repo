CANON-PREAMBLE v6f9d139b
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY (OPS-19, `F-` rows) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker; `25_atom_architecture_reference.md` is superseded for the model): four layers, five canonicalisation stages, each stage the executor of its `BP-` rules; own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store, console Smart Site Factory in `hauska-map/apps/factory`; staging Smart Site under the Factory base URL and every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`). **OPTION A ruled** (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): P-82-lite plus BP-WRITE-01 land on the existing writer as a bug fix; Bexar 48029 cad finishes on the current shape (660,000 of 703,257 done); NO new county is written on the old shape; Harris, Dallas and the Texas remainder wait for the conformant stage E writer (F-15, F-16, F-18). STATUS 2026-08-27: Phase A closed; F-02 runner `factory-atoms-cad` (us-east4, digest-pinned, run row first) is the only writer job; OLD-SHAPE WRITES ENDED permanently (no `--apply` through the old writer for any county; Bexar 703,257 = roll, complete); the store is still the old shape and still serves; next card is the conformant writer (F-16 resolution, F-17 reconcile, F-20 stage-and-merge write, F-18 intensional demotion) on one Texas source, F-15 types from the substrate seat by request, then F-10 drains Texas, then F-06 publishes. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — template Dashboards UI first, then one adapter/source onto `template-city`. Live Bastrop is an island, not the next card. Three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU. Feeds are adapters that write records. Destination still `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_then_bastrop_onboarding.md`. Next-card sequence `_decisions/2026-08-17_dashboards_ui_then_one_feed.md`. Gap map `_inbox/2026-08-17_dashboards_missing_pieces.md`.
- FEED ADAPTER CONTRACT (G-63 CLOSED) — kinds are a catalog; grants are per city pack. Write spine or files with provenance. Never a Dashboards vendor table. Never Pipedrive as a city feed. Samsara fleet copies are not G-24. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g63_feed_adapter_contract.md`.
- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant. Identified caller is a Hauska product key whose `jurisdiction_tenant` equals `cityKey`. `DASHBOARDS_API_KEY` is not a tenant. Fixture pack `fixture-city`. Not sprint-54 done. Not live ingest.

- G-45 SMARTSITE STAFF MAP (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards staff map is the SmartSite embed of gold `48021:34137`. GET `/` auto-loads it. Do not cut live Leaflet. Do not clone PE.

- COMPASS IS SHARED-ELEMENT SHEET CHROME — G-66 item. Top-bar source control, not a page, not a rail-only assistant. Answer engine is out of this wave. Old Compass is not the atom-render reference; SmartSite is. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_ux_implementation_sequence.md`.
- UX IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (G-67 first) — kit copy, then G-66 / G-68 / G-69 in parallel. Those three CLOSED 2026-08-17. G-24 stays zero. Live Bastrop no-touch.
- FILES COMPOSE THEN ONE FEED (G-70 G-71 G-72 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Work → Files mounts smart-files-app. G-71 wrote Bastrop municode meetings onto `template-city` files. That host is a HOLD (identity collapse), not a feed win. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_files_compose_then_one_feed.md`.
- SHELL BEFORE FEEDS (G-73 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Every G-18 / live-Bastrop staff function has a named home on the Dashboards shell. Connections is 67 of 67 Homes-table rows. Assets honest-empty.

AGENT-CONTRACT v1890f0bb — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# Finish containment; produce TOTALS for the first time

# Mission A1 — finish containment; produce TOTALS for the first time

## Why this card exists

Two counties of six are clean. Bastrop is licensed by run `85f984c2` on digest
`sha256:dd7c2a94`, and Hays completed in 14m16s over fifteen chunks with
`statement_timeout` unraised. **TOTALS has never existed.** This card produces it.

The instrument works. The 180s interactive ceiling was the instrument and not the
work, and chunking removed it. County size no longer determines completion; chunk
count does. So this is execution discipline, not a cost investigation.

## State per county, do not re-derive

| County | State |
|---|---|
| Bastrop 48021 | **licensed**, `85f984c2`, 50,264 / 11,992 / 62,256 |
| Hays 48209 | succeeded, `bdcf534f`, 116,420 rows |
| Caldwell 48055 | matched 14,361 / 10,627 / 24,988, run **hand-cancelled**; licensing ambiguous |
| McLennan 48309 | **bare count 114,254** on old digest `56a8ee75`, no restated triple, no sentinel disposition |
| Travis 48453 | `COUNTY_HELD`, 380,918 parcels |
| Williamson 48491 | `COUNTY_HELD`, 282,570 parcels |

## Order, and the discipline that makes each run trustworthy

**1. Resolve Caldwell.** Its numbers matched but the run was hand-cancelled because
the pre-#49 success path hung, and a planner termination was written over it. Decide
and state which: re-run it cleanly on a current digest so it holds a real succeeded
run, or record explicitly that its rows are licensed by an operator decision rather
than by a succeeded run. **Do not leave it ambiguous.** A hand-cancelled run is not a
write license.

**2. McLennan, properly.** The 114,254 is a count, not a verified triple, and no
sentinel was measured. Re-run on a current digest with the full discipline below.

**3. Williamson, then Travis.** Largest last.

**For every county, before you execute:**

- **Measure that county's sentinel.** Do not extrapolate. Bastrop's 168 rows resolved
  to one **unincorporated** key; Caldwell's 227 resolved to one **in-city** key
  (Mustang Ridge 50200), which is why its restated triple moved `in_city` and not
  `unincorporated`. Assuming a shape produces a refuse for the wrong reason and burns
  an execute.
- **State the restated triple** in your output before running. If a county carries no
  sentinel, say so as a measurement, not as an assumption.
- **State both falsifiers.** F1 is the triple, and anything else refuses
  `PARTITION_MISMATCH` and stops. F2 is a succeeded termination with an **unaided
  exit**.

**Verify the image by digest before each run.** Not the tag, not the generation, not
"main is at X". Factory builds ship storage tarballs with **no `COMMIT_SHA`**, so
image-to-commit attribution there is inference; `sha256:56a8ee75` was wrongly called
the #49 image off a build starting 16 seconds after the merge. Report the digest you
ran on.

## TOTALS

Only when all six counties have emitted from this job does TOTALS become measured.
Sum over the six, state the arithmetic, and name the run id that licenses each
county's rows. **Do not adopt 357,269 or any figure not produced by this job**; that
baseline was discarded as unrecoverable.

Cite the **store**, not a lane close. Two lanes ran Bastrop four minutes apart and the
bind moved from `1dda40f7` to `85f984c2`. A close is a claim about a moment; a bind is
a fact with a timestamp. Prove each county's bind with `GROUP BY run_id`.

## Do not

- Do not raise `statement_timeout` or change page size from 8,000.
- Do not soften `PARTITION_MISMATCH` or absorb a sentinel to make a number match.
- Do not hand-cancel a hang and write a success over it. Report the hang.
- Do not run two heavy store operations at once. **Confirm whether `neondb` and
  `hauska_mcp` share compute before assuming they do not contend** — that has not been
  measured, and lane A3 may be running.
- Do not fit a curve to per-chunk `wallMs`. Hays ranged 36.4 to 92.9 and licenses no
  size.
- Do not start the setback bake; it is gated by `PLACEHOLDER_COLLISION`, not by
  containment.
- Do not touch any repository other than the registered Factory worktree you open.

## Close

Use the exact CP1 / CP2 / CLOSE paths named at the end of this dispatch. Declare
snapshot including image digest in the first output. State both falsifiers per county
before executing. Report the licensing run id per county. `leave_behind` named.
Subagents do not commit.
