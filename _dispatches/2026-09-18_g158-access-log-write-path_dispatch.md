CANON-PREAMBLE v49001500
- COTALITY REST IS DEAD, THE VENDOR IS RE-ENGAGED FOR THE FARM, AND WE SHIP WITHOUT IT (operator 2026-09-16, `_decisions/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_sequence_and_four_rulings.md`; operator 2026-09-17, OPS-16 A-212): when code hits Cotality REST (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record and NEVER rotate the credential. The MCP eval channel is live for internal evaluation only. No vendor-sourced value reaches a customer until the commercial agreement is read, and the factory never bulk-calls the vendor. **The vendor is about two weeks out as of 2026-09-17 and NOTHING waits on it:** Cotality is struck from the Phase 0 exit criteria, and every rail that wanted it ships as a DECLARED absence — `unaccounted` at rest, labelled where a customer reads it, never fabricated, never a silent gap, and never relabelled `absent-verified` to clear a gate. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- DO TOOLING IS CONFIGURED FLEET-WIDE, BUT DOCTL AUTH IS PER-SESSION (operator 2026-09-17, corrected 2026-09-17 per OPS-25 D-11's close) — the `do-apps`/`do-droplets` MCP servers are configured in the global Cursor config on the fleet machine with an agent token scoped to Droplets and Apps only (no account, database, or networking access), and that MCP config travels with any lane using this machine's Cursor. `doctl`'s own CLI auth does NOT reliably carry over to every lane's session (found unauthenticated in D-11's environment) — a lane needing `doctl` specifically, not just the MCP tools, should confirm with `doctl account get` and run `doctl auth init` itself if needed, rather than assume it is live. Do not ask the operator to reconfigure the MCP servers or token; do check `doctl` auth per-session.

AGENT-CONTRACT v378cd643 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-17 govtech stack (Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, ICC demo)

You are working a lane of OPS-17. The rulings below were standing decisions in the shared
preamble until 2026-09-11; they are program law and moved here so lanes in other programs stop
carrying them. Each still binds every OPS-17 lane. If this section conflicts with the general
canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it conflicts with the AGENT
CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

- BASTROP IS THE PROVING PACK (operator 2026-09-18, `_decisions/2026-09-18_bastrop_is_the_proving_pack.md`, OPS-17 A-146). SmartCity designs are implemented and PROVEN on `bastrop_tx`, against the live data Bastrop already has wired. `template-city` is a demo and fixture pack, and a pass on it is not a pass on a Bastrop design. `bastrop_tx` grants seven live feeds today (municode calendar; MyGov, one kind-level grant covering permits, work orders, inspections, code violations and business licenses; Samsara, Spireon, FirstDue, Power BI CIP, GoTo), so Development services, Fleet, Police, Public works and Fire and EMS can read live Bastrop data now. Four rules. (1) Verify every dashboards design build on `bastrop_tx` and its granted feeds. (2) Bastrop data that is wired in v1 but not reachable from v2 (OpenGov, OpenGov budgeting and planning, v1 permit revenue, the v1 executive overview) is a BRIDGE to card, never a fixture to fall back on: a v1 platform route, a v2 adapter declaration, and a `bastrop_tx` grant. Until the bridge lands, the surface says so as a declared absence. (3) Never default a city: a route that takes `cityKey` REFUSES when it is missing, because a `template-city` default silently serves demo data. (4) v1 (`smartcity-os`, behind `smartcityos.io`) is still production. Adding a platform route to it is a bridge and is allowed; every v1 deploy goes by canary with `services[0].source_commit_hash` read back (OPS-25 rule 13), and the v1 surface Bastrop uses today is never broken. This SUPERSEDES the August template-city-first, "live Bastrop is an island", "live Bastrop no-touch" and "live Bastrop stays `smartcity-os`" rulings below, which were right when no Bastrop pack existed and were never retired after G-116 created one.
- A `bastrop_tx` PROOF NEEDS A CREDENTIAL, AND ONLY ONE KIND IS YOURS TO USE (OPS-17 A-148, G-135). A tenant-private pack answers 401 to an anonymous read on any deployed app. The key a lane may use is the verification-scoped `bastrop_tx` key minted under G-135; `_catalog/credential_access_index.json` (entry `hauska-tenant-key-bastrop_tx-lane-verification`) says whether it exists yet and where it lives. Read it into your process environment from inside a script file, and never print, commit or paste it. Never use the operator's own pilot key ("Nick, bastrop_tx staff pilot"), and never ask the operator to paste a key into a file. If the verification key does not exist yet, the `bastrop_tx` leg is UNMEASURED, and you say so; it is never replaced by a `template-city` pass. The refusal directions need no key, so prove them anyway: keyless is refused, `bastrop_tx` named anonymously is 401, and an unknown pack is 404.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — **SUPERSEDED IN PART 2026-09-18 (A-146):** the "template Dashboards UI first, then one feed onto `template-city`" sequencing and "live Bastrop is an island, not the next card" are retired by BASTROP IS THE PROVING PACK above.

## Mission - G-158: write down who opened a record, the access-log write path the audit trail cannot exist without

You launch no sub-agents (FAN-DEPTH 0). You WRITE in `smartcity-dashboards`. You write nothing in
`doc_repo` (hand any doc edit back as a diff, uncommitted), nothing in `smartcity-os`, and nothing in
`hauska-mcp-server`.

### Why this row exists

`_design/smartcity-people-and-access/` drew the audit trail, and the row's own words for why: it is "the
trust surface, not an admin screen", and it is "the half most likely to be dropped as internal". The
design then went looking for something to draw it from and found nothing. **A reference read at
`smartcity-dashboards` `3d3ec62a` across all 45 source files found no write path that records a staff
read anywhere.** So the design deliberately renders "Who looked" as NOT RECORDED, because an empty table
would read as "nobody looked", which is a different and false answer.

**You build the thing that lets it answer.** At the moment of every read by a signed-in staff identity,
write one record naming who (the staff `sub`), which record, which lens, and when, scoped to the tenant
so one city's reads never show on another's.

### Read this before you decide you are blocked, because two things in the card will look like blockers and are not

**1. The card names `G-134` for "a staff identity to attribute a read to". `G-134` is CLOSED-PARTIAL.**
Its only outstanding item is a real-WorkOS violation test (P13, UNVERIFIED-LIVE) that waits on the
operator's WorkOS credentials. **That does not block this row.** `G-134`'s wiring is built and merged
(PR #65, `f776b4bf`) and it measured two live-local end-to-end sign-in tests passing, so the staff
identity resolution you need is already there. Your acceptance is stated against a **named fixture staff
identity**, not a real person. Build and verify against the fixture path. Do not wait on credentials, do
not register a WorkOS account, and do not provision a real Bastrop user. If you find the identity
plumbing genuinely absent, say so with the read that shows it rather than guessing.

**2. Clause 3 of the acceptance spans repos and is HELD, not yours to build.** The card reads "reads
through the MCP surface are logged the same way", but `_catalog/repo_intents.md` is explicit: this
product's "MCP tools on hauska-mcp-server PR 70", and the repo row for `smartcity-dashboards` carries
"Not `smartcity-os`". The MCP surface for these lenses is therefore a different repo and a different
card. This is the identical shape to `G-134`'s GAP 2, recorded there as "NOT this row, OPS-19/OPS-23
territory, report only", and it is resolved the same way here. **REPORT, do not build:** name the MCP
surface you found, the repo it lives in, and where the log write would have to land, and file that in
your close so the planner can card it. Held clause, declared in the row by amendment, not silently
dropped.

### Acceptance, verbatim from the row

> A read by a named fixture staff identity writes exactly one record carrying who, which record, which
> lens and when, and a second identity's read writes a second; a forced log-write failure REFUSES the
> read rather than serving it, verified by violation; reads through the MCP surface are logged the same
> way; a tenant's reads never appear under another tenant; and `dump-source-state.mjs` then reports an
> access-log write path, which makes the current "Who looked" board refuse to render until it is redrawn
> against the real trail.

Read clause 2 as the load-bearing one. **The record is not the point; the refusal is.** A trail with
invisible holes is worse than no trail, because it reads as complete. If a read is served while its log
write silently failed, you have built a surface that will testify falsely, which is the exact defect
class this row exists to remove.

### Prove it by violation, in both directions, before you call it done

- **Pre-fix, show the absence:** drive a staff read on the unmodified code and show that no record is
  written, and that the "Who looked" surface correspondingly reports it cannot answer. That is the
  falsifier for the whole row and it must fail before your change.
- **Post-fix, show it can refuse:** force the log write to fail (a bad DSN, a closed pool, whatever the
  real failure is) and confirm the read is REFUSED rather than served. **A read that falls back to
  serving on log failure is the defect wearing the new code**, and this is the one plant that must be
  caught.
- **Post-fix, show tenant scoping by violation:** read as tenant A, then confirm the record does not
  appear for tenant B. A scoping claim tested only by reading its own tenant has not been tested.
- **Then confirm the design behaves as designed:** `dump-source-state.mjs` reports an access-log write
  path, and the current "Who looked" board consequently refuses to render.

### What you must not do

- **Do not redraw `_design/smartcity-people-and-access/` or "Who looked".** The board refusing to render
  once your write path exists is the mechanism working exactly as designed, not a regression to repair.
  Redrawing it against the real trail is a follow-on, and it belongs to whoever owns the design gate
  after you land. **Leave it failing and say so in your close**, so it is carded rather than quietly
  absorbed. A design-only repair here would also be fixing the prose to match a write path that has not
  been independently verified, which is the mistake `G-164` deliberately avoided on the flood study.
- **Do not build the MCP leg.** See above. Report where it goes.
- **Do not retire the shared persona, and do not touch the WorkOS wiring.** `G-134`'s sequencing rule is
  not negotiable: wire, provision and verify a real account, and only then retire the shared persona.
  Removing it before a real credential exists takes live Bastrop staff access to zero. That is a customer
  outage, and it is not this row.
- **Do not loosen the failure path to make a test pass.** Widening so a failed log write still serves is
  the defect, not the fix.

### Evidence your close must carry

- The pre-fix read showing no record written, with the file and line you searched and the moment you read
  it (a claim about absence needs a timestamp and a search, or it is not a ground-truth).
- The post-fix: two fixture identities, two records, all four fields, plus the tenant-scoping violation.
- **The forced-failure refusal, pasted.** This is the clause that decides whether the row is met.
- The MCP surface you found, the repo it lives in, and where the log write would have to land, so the
  held clause can be carded with a real target rather than a description.
- Confirmation, with output, that the "Who looked" board now refuses to render, and that you left it that
  way on purpose.
- Your test suite's baseline and after counts, with any pre-existing failures named as inherited rather
  than as regressions you caused.
- Your snapshot (repo, ref, moment read) and the exact commit your checks ran against per
  `ENFORCEMENT.md`.
- Your scratch block (LESSON / DEAD-END / GROUND-TRUTH with a timestamp / OPEN), returned in the close.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-18_g158-access-log-write-path_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-18_g158-access-log-write-path_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-18_g158-access-log-write-path_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "g158-access-log-write-path",
    "planRows": ["G-158"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "...",
    "subAgents": { "spawned": <int>, "maxDepth": <int> }
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
  subAgents is required and honest: spawned counts every sub-agent this lane launched, maxDepth
  is the deepest level reached (0 when none), and neither may exceed FAN-DEPTH 0.
