CANON-PREAMBLE v6f9d139b
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY (OPS-19, `F-` rows) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker; `25_atom_architecture_reference.md` is superseded for the model): four layers, five canonicalisation stages, each stage the executor of its `BP-` rules; own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store, console Smart Site Factory in `hauska-map/apps/factory`; staging Smart Site under the Factory base URL and every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`). **OPTION A ruled** (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): P-82-lite plus BP-WRITE-01 land on the existing writer as a bug fix; Bexar 48029 cad finishes on the current shape (660,000 of 703,257 done); NO new county is written on the old shape; Harris, Dallas and the Texas remainder wait for the conformant stage E writer (F-15, F-16, F-18). STATUS 2026-08-27: Phase A closed; F-02 runner `factory-atoms-cad` (us-east4, digest-pinned, run row first) is the only writer job; OLD-SHAPE WRITES ENDED permanently (no `--apply` through the old writer for any county; Bexar 703,257 = roll, complete); the store is still the old shape and still serves; next card is the conformant writer (F-16 resolution, F-17 reconcile, F-20 stage-and-merge write, F-18 intensional demotion) on one Texas source, F-15 types from the substrate seat by request, then F-10 drains Texas, then F-06 publishes. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — template Dashboards UI first, then one adapter/source onto `template-city`. Live Bastrop is an island, not the next card. Three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU.

- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant.

AGENT-CONTRACT v1890f0bb — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# Bastrop on the #49 image: the succeeded run that licenses the landing rows

# Mission — Bastrop on the #49 image: the run that licenses everything downstream

## Why this card exists

Hays completed. Caldwell matched. Bastrop is the only county of the three that has
never produced a **succeeded** run, and its 62,256 landing rows are therefore
unlicensed. That single gap now blocks more than it looks like:

- TOTALS cannot be measured without it.
- The Bastrop setback bake, ruled authoritative on 2026-08-31, waits on a named
  succeeded Bastrop run or an explicit operator license of those rows.
- P3 absence has no inputs until containment lands.

One re-run clears all three.

## What changed since the refuse

**The oracle was restated and the ruling is recorded** (`d86b6cb`). Bastrop 48021 is
**50,264 / 11,992 / 62,256**. The sentinel is 168 rows resolving to one
**unincorporated** key, excluded as `txgio_parcel_sentinel_zero`. The earlier
62,257 came from an interactive instrument that counted the sentinel; three sources
(job, landing, ledger) agree on 62,256.

Do not re-derive this and do not soften `PARTITION_MISMATCH`. The refuse was the
control working.

**Factory #49 (`5f9acc3`) fixes the close path.** Caldwell exposed it: the SUCCESS
path left the Factory pg client open, Node never exited, and Cloud Run sat idle.
Bastrop's earlier run only terminated because the throw calls `process.exit(1)`. So
the failure path exits and the success path hangs, and Caldwell had to be cancelled
by hand with a planner-written termination.

**Run on the #49 image. Not the image that ran `gzr6z`.**

## Two falsifiers, and the second has never been observed

State both before executing.

**F1, the numbers.** Bastrop must emit exactly **50,264 / 11,992 / 62,256**. Any
other triple refuses `PARTITION_MISMATCH` and the run stops. Diagnose, do not tune,
do not absorb the sentinel to make the number look right.

**F2, the close path.** The job must reach a **succeeded termination and the process
must exit on its own.** This is what #49 changes and **no succeeded containment run
has ever exited unaided** — Caldwell's was cancelled. If the process hangs after a
successful write, #49 did not fix it, and that is a finding to report rather than
work around with another manual cancel. Do not write a planner termination to paper
over a hang; report the hang.

A run that satisfies F1 and hangs on F2 has not succeeded. Both arms or it is not
done.

## What a succeeded run licenses, and what it does not

**Licenses:** the 62,256 rows in `landing_parcel_jurisdiction` become bound to a
succeeded run, which is the mechanism a downstream consumer requires. Say so
explicitly in the close, naming the run id, so the setback bake has a citable
authority rather than an inference.

**Does not license:** Travis or Williamson leaving `COUNTY_HELD`, the setback bake
starting (it is separately gated by `P4-QUARANTINE`, because one placeholder parcel
throws `PLACEHOLDER_COLLISION` and aborts the whole city plan), or any statement
about TOTALS, which stays UNMEASURED until all six counties emit.

## Then, in order

**McLennan 48309** next, and measure its sentinel first. Bastrop's resolved
unincorporated and Caldwell's resolved **in-city** (Mustang Ridge 50200), which is
why Caldwell's restated triple moved `in_city` rather than `unincorporated`.
Assuming a shape produces a wrong expectation and a refuse for the wrong reason.
State McLennan's restated triple before executing it.

**Travis and Williamson** release from `COUNTY_HELD` only after McLennan lands.
They are larger, and with chunking that means more chunks rather than a cliff. Do
not predict their wall time and do not pick a chunk size from Hays.

## Do not

- Do not run on the pre-#49 image.
- Do not soften `PARTITION_MISMATCH` or absorb the sentinel.
- Do not hand-cancel a hang and write a success over it. Report it.
- Do not raise `statement_timeout` or change the page size from 8,000.
- Do not run two heavy operations concurrently.
- Do not fit a curve to per-chunk `wallMs`. Hays ranged 36.4 to 92.9 and licenses
  no size.
- Do not start the setback bake from this card.
- Do not run Travis or Williamson.
- Do not touch any repository other than the registered Factory worktree you open.

## Close

Use the exact CP1 / CP2 / CLOSE paths named at the end of this dispatch. Declare
snapshot (repo, branch, commit, image digest) in the first output. State both
falsifiers before executing. Report the run id and whether the process exited
unaided. `leave_behind` named. Subagents do not commit.
