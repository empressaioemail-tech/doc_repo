CANON-PREAMBLE v6302c07c
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- DO TOOLING IS LIVE FLEET-WIDE (operator 2026-09-17) — doctl and the DigitalOcean MCP servers (`do-apps`, `do-droplets`) are configured in the global Cursor config on the fleet machine, authenticated with an agent token scoped to Droplets and Apps only (no account, database, or networking access). Any lane doing DigitalOcean provisioning or migration work has this available without further setup; do not ask the operator to configure it again.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v378cd643 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

PLAN-ROW: P-299, P-282 (90_operations/OPS-16_texas_market_plan_of_record.md)
repo: hauska-engine
FAN-DEPTH: 0
This lane launches NO sub-agents. Do the work yourself. The commit gate refuses a close that declares any (A-181).

CLAIM YOUR LANE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE. This dispatch may have been handed to
more than one session. Run this FIRST, from the doc_repo worktree you are rooted in:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs claim --lane p299-engine-corpus-and-slate --seat <your-seat-id> --plan-row P-299 --dispatch _dispatches/2026-09-17_p299-engine-corpus-and-slate_dispatch.md

Exit 0 means proceed. **Exit 3 means another seat is already executing this lane:
STAND DOWN, do not execute, and report which seat holds it.** Exit 4 means the claim
is stale — confirm the holder is gone before re-running with --force. Release when
your close is filed:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs release --lane p299-engine-corpus-and-slate --seat <your-seat-id>

On 2026-09-14 this exact dispatch shape was handed to two sessions at once. One found
out mid-execution from a merged commit appearing in its own fetch.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-24 county to serving

You are working a lane of OPS-24. Everything below is program law for this lane. If it
conflicts with the general canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it
conflicts with the AGENT CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

## The one goal

A county goes from "not in the product" to "a customer types a real address in that county
and the card, the MCP and the PDF agree, and every value carries its source and vintage"
through ONE pipeline of thirteen stages, each with a predicate that can fail and an instrument
that measures it, at a cost the kill test can read. Not "acquire everything". The sequence is
ruled (operator 2026-09-16, `_decisions/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_sequence_and_four_rulings.md`,
scope `_inbox/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_program_scope.md`):

1. **Phase 0:** the six onboarded counties complete and verified.
2. **Phase 1:** Burnet with its cities as the first county through the farm, with the farm built
   and refined during that run.
3. **Phase 2:** Bell and Milam through the farm in parallel.
4. **Then** the rest of Texas.

## Seven laws

1. **The customer predicate is the definition of done.** `scripts/surface-probe.mjs` with a
   real address in the county is the finish line for every stage, not stage 12's private
   check. A stage that cannot be traced to a change in what the probe reads is not on this
   program. ARMED 2026-09-14 on the enforcement side: `probe-close-gate.mjs` gates every
   OPS-24 row and prints the predicate debt on each close until `surface-probe.mjs` carries
   the stage's row (P-197); a close with neither an artifact nor a declared
   `probe.notApplicable` (read-only reviews only) is refused. **A store-reading instrument is
   never the customer predicate** (A-183): the factory-store and atoms-store instruments were
   green through the whole 2026-09-15 map incident. The probe's OPS-24 legs are P-254.
2. **The gate is fixed before anything trusts it. Three things are called "the gate"; know
   which one you are touching (A-183).**
   - **The publish refusal** is `requirePreBakeReadiness` (factory
     `src/lib/publish-readiness-gate.mjs`, called by the publish job): a population check, then
     `evaluatePreBakeReadiness` over the publish-floor rails' verdicts.
   - **The rail verdicts** are `evaluateRailGate`, written hourly to `parcel_gate_verdict` by
     `publish-gate-sched.mjs` and labelled by P-201's `classifyExclusion`.
   - **`evaluatePublishGate` and `assertPublishableCounty` have no production caller.** Do not
     cite them as a control.
   - **Fixed:** P-195 closed the ZERO-ROW case (`RAIL_NEVER_FILLED`,
     `BAKE_POPULATION_UNMEASURED`).
   - **Still open, measured by violation 2026-09-16 after P-201 merged:** the ZERO-EARNED case.
     A county whose 65 rails all hold `unaccounted` cells gets `excluded-not-applicable` on
     every rail (basis `LIVE_ELSEWHERE`), and the pre-bake rail check clears it because it tests
     only `verdict === "refuse"`. **P-252 closes it, proven by a checked-in fixture that must
     REFUSE, before any new county's verdict is trusted.**
3. **One county at a time until the farm is proven** (rewritten 2026-09-16 to the operator's
   sequence).
   - Burnet is the first county through the farm. The farm's machinery (manifest, pre-bake
     audit, completeness check, stage meter, merge gate) is built and refined during that run,
     and every defect Burnet finds is fixed upstream, never in the county.
   - Burnet runs on the shared stores with full stage telemetry (A-180).
   - Bell and Milam then run in parallel. Whether they need isolated stores is decided from
     Burnet's measured stage records, not in advance.
   - The fleet has learned twice that blockers surface serially; one county finds them faster
     than a wave does.
4. **Three operator stop points, and only three:** a new credential or secret mount, a write
   to a production serving store, a ruling. Everything else runs unattended and leaves a
   record naming what it touched.
5. **Every stage meters itself.** Compute dollars and operator minutes per county per stage
   go on the stage's run record, so commitment 3 (under 200 dollars and one hour per county)
   can fire as a kill, not a slogan. **As of 2026-09-16 nothing records either** (no column,
   table or writer at factory `9171279`); P-284 builds it and Burnet does not start without it.
6. **Nothing is measured once and published as state.** A number on this program's card
   names its SHA and its date. OPS-23's live card is authoritative where the two programs
   touch (serving, identity, the ledger).
7. **The county verdict is a grade, not the serve switch** (operator ruling 2026-09-16, A-193,
   `_decisions/2026-09-16_county_verdict_is_not_the_serve_switch.md`, build row P-297).
   - `parcel_gate_verdict` answers "is this rail complete enough in this county to publish".
     The publish gate reads it; nothing else may use it to choose what a parcel shows.
   - On a slated rail each parcel is served from its OWN cell: an earned value as that value; an
     absence as the stated absence with its reason; `refused`, `unaccounted`, a missing cell or an
     unreadable store as a declared refusal with its reason. Never the legacy or baked value.
   - Until P-297 is live, the serve path still switches on the county verdict (LDT
     `resolveAllowlistState`, retrieval-api `parcel-record-reader.ts`). So **any write that puts
     an unaccounted cell on a slated rail turns that whole county's ledger values back to the
     bake**. A lane whose writer can do that states it in CP1 and does not apply before P-297.
   - An instrument never reads "slated and `pass`" as "served from the ledger"; it reads the cell.

## Identity and vintage, inherited as law

The OPS-21 identity paragraph applies: `place_key` is the parcel-map id; in a two-namespace
county the account joins only through the published crosswalk; never by bare number. The
P-178 vintage rule applies: a county's declared roll is a decision with a marker for accounts
that fall off, never an upsert that keeps notice values silently.

## Out of scope until after Phase 2 (A-177)

The road-node pass: a TIGER cross-check, a street-name dictionary, classification rules, and the
`roads` and `edgeSignal` ledger rails. Study road data only where it blocks envelope or footprint
rendering, and say exactly where. **The measurement of "blocks rendering" is P-264's per-city
residual** (the verification re-derive runs in Phase 0 without the road-name dictionary);
a city whose residual is dominated by road failures comes back to the operator for a ruling.

## The Phase 0 exit (scope rev 4, section 5)

One definition, all legs at once: the ledger leg (`six-county-completeness.mjs`, repaired by
P-253), the customer leg (`surface-probe.mjs` over the 39-bucket fixture list, P-254), the
coverage leg (P-210), the road residual (P-264), and the operator's walk. **Burnet's run waits
on it, and the long pole is the setback acquisition campaign (P-258), not the gate rows.** The
farm machinery builds in parallel.

## Traps the final teardown found (A-183); read before touching these surfaces

- The depth-warm wire field is `depthWarmPromotion === "depth-warm-promoted-v1"` (with a
  `sourceCitation` fallback), not `depthWarmPromoted`. Four predicates read this fact in three
  repos; a change to one carries a divergence test against the others.
- `unaccounted` does not refuse on every surface. LDT's dollar rails keep the legacy value and
  `valueBasis` defaults a label (P-269). A write that flips cells to `unaccounted` names its rail
  allowlist.
- The 2026-09-15 blank map was a stale browser tab after a rollback, not a one-branch server
  regression (A-157). A staging proof records the serving build by asset existence, never by
  `Age:`, and measures from a fresh browser context.
- A buildable-area figure appears only when a VERIFIED envelope atom backs it (A-180). The MCP
  payload and the PDF do not enforce that today (P-249, P-261).
- The doc_repo commit gates do not fire in a seat worktree or on a merge until P-280 lands.
  Declare `subAgents` and the probe honestly anyway; the integration seat re-grades on landing.
- Bell already serves from the July bake (165,574 rows). It is a migration county (P-291).

## What this program absorbs

OPS-21's unfinished writers (stage 6), OPS-23's serving seams (stages 10 and 11), P-124's bake
(stages 9 and 10), P-156 (stage 0), P-181 (stages 2 and 9), P-182 (stage 0), P-184 (stage 4).
Each absorbed row keeps its number and its close history; OPS-24 rows name what they absorb.


## Mission — P-299 (engine half) and P-282 (slate): the engine reads corpus 1.4.0 and LDT's current slate

You launch no sub-agents (FAN-DEPTH 0). You build in `hauska-engine` and open a PR. You do not
merge or deploy; the integration seat deploys hauska-retrieval-api and hauska-engine-api after merge.

### Where you work

`hauska-engine`, fresh clone from `origin/main` under `P:/tmp/` into a NEW directory, branch
`fix/p299-engine-corpus-and-slate`. Declare the start commit (engine main `7b3dda0b` at compile).
Register the clone under the property seat and remove the entry at close.

### Part 1: corpus 1.4.0 (P-299's engine half; A-202 left it open)

- `packages/adapters/package.json` pins `@empressaio/setback-corpus` `^1.2.0`, and the lockfile
  resolves `1.2.0`. The factory pins exact `1.4.0` (P-256b, factory `c5622d0b`) and LDT ships
  1.4.0's tables (P-299, LDT `710d5bb7`).
- `packages/adapters/src/local/setbacks/*.json` are 14 vendored tables, guarded by
  `__tests__/corpus-divergence.test.ts`. P-299 measured the engine's verdict against 1.4.0
  (`_inbox/2026-09-17_p299-height-flag-and-state_consumers-engine.txt`, UTF-16): 23 numeric
  mismatches, all `max_height_ft` (san-antonio-tx 17, bastrop-city-tx 6), and 98
  verification-state changes (`primary-source-verified` to `transcription-read`) that the test's
  rank map cannot see.
- **Build:** move the pin to exact `1.4.0` in `package.json` and the lockfile together; correct the
  vendored tables to 1.4.0; teach the divergence test's rank map the `transcription-read` state
  (P-299's fourth state, with its lower confidence cap) so a state change is visible, not silently
  passing; and make sure the engine never serves a flagged height as a number (the same rule LDT's
  `buildableEnvelope/derive.ts` and `/local-setbacks` now follow). Update
  `services/retrieval-api/src/__fixtures__/cell-serve-rule.json` where it cites `@1.3.0` sources, or
  say why it must not change.
- Pin, lockfile and vendored tables are one fact in several places (P-256b's lesson). Move them in
  one commit, and say which pair is guarded at runtime and which only by a test.

### Part 2: the reader slate (P-282 scope; A-204 finding)

- `services/retrieval-api/src/parcel-record-slate.json` is a vendored copy of LDT's
  `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/parcelRecordAllowlist.ts` `PARCEL_RECORD_SLATE`, vendored 2026-09-13
  (152 pairs). LDT has since lifted P-177's hold on six Hays record-overlay rails, and this copy
  lacks them. `parcel-record-slate.test.ts` is supposed to guard drift.
- **Build:** re-vendor the slate from LDT main (read it at a named commit, and record that commit as
  `sourceCommit`; LDT main is `8e7218f7` at compile) as data, never retyped. List every pair added
  or removed with the reason from LDT's own history, and confirm each added pair's
  `parcel_gate_verdict` reads `pass` today (read-only). Then show why the existing divergence test
  did not fail on the stale copy, and make it fail on a stale copy (for example, compare against
  LDT's file at the recorded commit in CI, or a checked-in digest that a resync must update in both
  repos). If a real cross-repo check is not buildable here, say so and name what is.

### Falsifiers — pre-register your predictions before building

1. With the pin at 1.4.0 and the tables uncorrected, the divergence test fails on the 23 heights;
   with them corrected, it passes; and a table left at a `primary-source-verified` state the corpus
   now calls `transcription-read` fails the test.
2. A flagged height never reaches an engine output as a number (test through the engine's own
   consumer).
3. The re-vendored slate equals LDT's at the recorded commit, and the drift test fails on the
   pre-resync copy.
4. A slated Hays record-overlay rail is served from its cell by the retrieval reader in a test.

### Do not

- Merge, deploy, or write any store.
- Edit LDT or the corpus repo; a corpus defect goes in the close.
- Launch sub-agents.

### Close

Snapshot; files touched; the PR with every CI check's literal conclusion string; the table and
height corrections by jurisdiction; the slate delta with reasons and live verdicts; the falsifiers
with evidence. `status`: `closed-partial` until the integration seat deploys retrieval-api and
engine-api and a Hays record-overlay rail and a Round Rock height are graded live. `probe`:
`{"notApplicable": "build lane; graded on the deployed reader and export"}`. `subAgents`.
`leave_behind`.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-17_p299-engine-corpus-and-slate_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-17_p299-engine-corpus-and-slate_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-17_p299-engine-corpus-and-slate_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "p299-engine-corpus-and-slate",
    "planRows": ["P-299", "P-282"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "...",
    "subAgents": { "spawned": <int>, "maxDepth": <int> }
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
  subAgents is required and honest: spawned counts every sub-agent this lane launched, maxDepth
  is the deepest level reached (0 when none), and neither may exceed FAN-DEPTH 0.
