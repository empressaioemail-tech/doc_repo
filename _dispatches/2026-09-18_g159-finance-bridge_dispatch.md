CANON-PREAMBLE v49001500
- COTALITY REST IS DEAD, THE VENDOR IS RE-ENGAGED FOR THE FARM, AND WE SHIP WITHOUT IT (operator 2026-09-16, `_decisions/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_sequence_and_four_rulings.md`; operator 2026-09-17, OPS-16 A-212): when code hits Cotality REST (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record and NEVER rotate the credential. The MCP eval channel is live for internal evaluation only. No vendor-sourced value reaches a customer until the commercial agreement is read, and the factory never bulk-calls the vendor. **The vendor is about two weeks out as of 2026-09-17 and NOTHING waits on it:** Cotality is struck from the Phase 0 exit criteria, and every rail that wanted it ships as a DECLARED absence — `unaccounted` at rest, labelled where a customer reads it, never fabricated, never a silent gap, and never relabelled `absent-verified` to clear a gate. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- DO TOOLING IS CONFIGURED FLEET-WIDE, BUT DOCTL AUTH IS PER-SESSION (operator 2026-09-17, corrected 2026-09-17 per OPS-25 D-11's close) — the `do-apps`/`do-droplets` MCP servers are configured in the global Cursor config on the fleet machine with an agent token scoped to Droplets and Apps only (no account, database, or networking access), and that MCP config travels with any lane using this machine's Cursor. `doctl`'s own CLI auth does NOT reliably carry over to every lane's session (found unauthenticated in D-11's environment) — a lane needing `doctl` specifically, not just the MCP tools, should confirm with `doctl account get` and run `doctl auth init` itself if needed, rather than assume it is live. Do not ask the operator to reconfigure the MCP servers or token; do check `doctl` auth per-session.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v378cd643 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

PLAN-ROW: G-159 (90_operations/OPS-17_govtech_stack_plan_of_record.md)
repo: smartcity-os
FAN-DEPTH: 0
This lane launches NO sub-agents. Do the work yourself. The commit gate refuses a close that declares any (A-181).

CLAIM YOUR LANE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE. This dispatch may have been handed to
more than one session. Run this FIRST, from the doc_repo worktree you are rooted in:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs claim --lane g159-finance-bridge --seat <your-seat-id> --plan-row G-159 --dispatch _dispatches/2026-09-18_g159-finance-bridge_dispatch.md

Exit 0 means proceed. **Exit 3 means another seat is already executing this lane:
STAND DOWN, do not execute, and report which seat holds it.** Exit 4 means the claim
is stale — confirm the holder is gone before re-running with --force. Release when
your close is filed:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs release --lane g159-finance-bridge --seat <your-seat-id>

On 2026-09-14 this exact dispatch shape was handed to two sessions at once. One found
out mid-execution from a merged commit appearing in its own fetch.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-17 govtech stack (Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, ICC demo)

You are working a lane of OPS-17. The rulings below were standing decisions in the shared
preamble until 2026-09-11; they are program law and moved here so lanes in other programs stop
carrying them. Each still binds every OPS-17 lane. If this section conflicts with the general
canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it conflicts with the AGENT
CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

- BASTROP IS THE PROVING PACK (operator 2026-09-18, `_decisions/2026-09-18_bastrop_is_the_proving_pack.md`, OPS-17 A-146). SmartCity designs are implemented and PROVEN on `bastrop_tx`, against the live data Bastrop already has wired. `template-city` is a demo and fixture pack, and a pass on it is not a pass on a Bastrop design. `bastrop_tx` grants seven live feeds today (municode calendar; MyGov, one kind-level grant covering permits, work orders, inspections, code violations and business licenses; Samsara, Spireon, FirstDue, Power BI CIP, GoTo), so Development services, Fleet, Police, Public works and Fire and EMS can read live Bastrop data now. Four rules. (1) Verify every dashboards design build on `bastrop_tx` and its granted feeds. (2) Bastrop data that is wired in v1 but not reachable from v2 (OpenGov, OpenGov budgeting and planning, v1 permit revenue, the v1 executive overview) is a BRIDGE to card, never a fixture to fall back on: a v1 platform route, a v2 adapter declaration, and a `bastrop_tx` grant. Until the bridge lands, the surface says so as a declared absence. (3) Never default a city: a route that takes `cityKey` REFUSES when it is missing, because a `template-city` default silently serves demo data. (4) v1 (`smartcity-os`, behind `smartcityos.io`) is still production. Adding a platform route to it is a bridge and is allowed; every v1 deploy goes by canary with `services[0].source_commit_hash` read back (OPS-25 rule 13), and the v1 surface Bastrop uses today is never broken. This SUPERSEDES the August template-city-first, "live Bastrop is an island", "live Bastrop no-touch" and "live Bastrop stays `smartcity-os`" rulings below, which were right when no Bastrop pack existed and were never retired after G-116 created one.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — **SUPERSEDED IN PART 2026-09-18 (A-146):** the "template Dashboards UI first, then one feed onto `template-city`" sequencing and "live Bastrop is an island, not the next card" are retired by BASTROP IS THE PROVING PACK above. Still in force: three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU. Feeds are adapters that write records. Destination still `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_then_bastrop_onboarding.md`. Next-card sequence `_decisions/2026-08-17_dashboards_ui_then_one_feed.md`. Gap map `_inbox/2026-08-17_dashboards_missing_pieces.md`.
- FEED ADAPTER CONTRACT (G-63 CLOSED) — kinds are a catalog; grants are per city pack. Write spine or files with provenance. Never a Dashboards vendor table. Never Pipedrive as a city feed. Samsara fleet copies are not G-24. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g63_feed_adapter_contract.md`.
- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant. Identified caller is a Hauska product key whose `jurisdiction_tenant` equals `cityKey`. `DASHBOARDS_API_KEY` is not a tenant. Fixture pack `fixture-city`. Not sprint-54 done. Not live ingest.

- COMPASS IS SHARED-ELEMENT SHEET CHROME — G-66 item. Top-bar source control, not a page, not a rail-only assistant. Answer engine is out of this wave. Old Compass is not the atom-render reference; SmartSite is. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_ux_implementation_sequence.md`.
- UX IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (G-67 first) — kit copy, then G-66 / G-68 / G-69 in parallel. Those three CLOSED 2026-08-17. G-24 stays zero. (The "live Bastrop no-touch" clause is SUPERSEDED 2026-09-18, A-146; see BASTROP IS THE PROVING PACK. v1 is still never broken, per its rule 4.)
- FILES COMPOSE THEN ONE FEED (G-70 G-71 G-72 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Work → Files mounts smart-files-app. G-71 wrote Bastrop municode meetings onto `template-city` files. That host is a HOLD (identity collapse), not a feed win. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_files_compose_then_one_feed.md`.
- SHELL BEFORE FEEDS (G-73 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Every G-18 / live-Bastrop staff function has a named home on the Dashboards shell. Connections is 67 of 67 Homes-table rows. Assets honest-empty.

- SMARTCITY VISUAL LAW (session 1, operator loved 2026-08-17) — quiet surfaces, loud exceptions, honest absence. Register not card deck. Sidebar. Inverted applicability (Pass quiet, Unchecked hatch).

Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_dashboards_housing.md`.


## Mission — G-159: the finance bridge, as far as it can go before D-13 and D-14

You launch no sub-agents (FAN-DEPTH 0). You work in two repos, `smartcity-os` (v1) and
`smartcity-dashboards` (v2), in the order below. You fix your own failed builds rather than
escalating them.

Read the G-159 row in `90_operations/OPS-17_govtech_stack_plan_of_record.md`, then
`_decisions/2026-09-18_bastrop_is_the_proving_pack.md`, then `_design/smartcity-finance-lens/README.md`.
The program preamble compiled above now LEADS with "Bastrop is the proving pack". It binds this
lane: prove everything on `bastrop_tx` and against Bastrop's real data, and `template-city` is no proof.

### Why this row exists

Bastrop's finance data is wired into v1, and v2 cannot reach it. That is why the G-156 Finance lens
renders the budget UNACCOUNTED. v1 `smartcity-os` has `server/routes/opengov.ts` (entities, financial,
reports), `opengov-bnp.ts` (budgets, chart of accounts, data exports, entity info, segment names,
sync) and `finance.ts` (permit revenue by type, outstanding, summary). All of it is present at
production `8bea7fa`, and the keys exist in production in both projects: `smartcity-OPENGOV_API_KEY`,
`smartcity-OPENGOV_BNP_API_KEY` and `smartcity-OPENGOV_EMAIL` in `smartcity-os-prod`, and
`opengov-api-key`, `opengov-bnp-api-key` and `opengov-email` in `smartcity-dashboards`. None of it has
a v1 platform route, so v2 has no path to it.

The G-156 lens is not to be rebuilt. It derives every state from the active pack's grants, so once
this data is declared and granted, the budget moves from UNACCOUNTED to MEASURED with no lens change.

### What this row can finish, and what it cannot

**Going live waits on two OPS-25 rows, and they are not yours.** D-14: `walrus-app` builds from branch
`d9-api-8bea7fa`, which v1 `main` does not contain, so routes merged to `main` never deploy. D-13: the
dashboards read every v1 platform route from the GCP copy (`smartcity-api-7dyaiy7wha-uc.a.run.app`),
not from `walrus-app`, so they could not reach new routes even once deployed. **Do not deploy v1, and
do not deploy anything to the GCP `smartcity-api`.** It is the untouched rollback copy (OPS-25 rule 3),
and it is also the dashboards' live data source.

### STEP 0 — prove the keys answer, before any code

The credentials exist. That they return live Bastrop data is not established: v1 sits behind a login
and now runs on DigitalOcean. **This is your first act and it gates everything else.**

Read how `server/routes/opengov.ts` and `opengov-bnp.ts` call OpenGov, then make one authenticated
read the same way, directly, using the key from `smartcity-os-prod` Secret Manager. Never print a key;
echo its length only. Record the endpoint, the status, and the response SHAPE (field names and types,
and one record with any personal data redacted) as CP1.

**Pre-register the falsifier:** if the read is refused, empty, or returns data that is not Bastrop's,
STOP and report. Do not build a bridge to a source that does not answer.

Before writing new code, look at the unmerged `smartcity-os` branch `fix/w1-c-3-opengov-bnp-hardening`.
It may already hold OpenGov work you should build on rather than duplicate. Say what you found.

### STEP 1 — v1 platform routes, merged to `main`, NOT deployed

Map the Finance lens design's required sources (its README and `capture-figures.json`) to the v1
OpenGov, budgeting-and-planning and permit-revenue data. Add platform routes only for what the design
uses, behind `requirePlatformInternalKey`, on the pattern of the thirteen that already exist (for
example `/api/platform/powerbi/cip-projects`). Each route REFUSES without the key and answers with it;
prove both directions. Branch from `main` and merge to `main`. `main` is one commit past production and
that commit touches only the scraper, so the API is unaffected.

### STEP 2 — v2: declare the adapter, and fix the city default

**Wait for G-154 to merge before starting this step.** G-154 is working in `smartcity-dashboards` now,
and two lanes in one product repo is how two changes to `city-pack.mjs` collide.

(a) Declare the OpenGov adapter kind. It is catalogued `declared: false` because its budget record
shape is not declared on G-91. Declare that shape, and validate it against the REAL record you captured
in STEP 0, not against a `template-city` fixture. On a record that fails the shape, refuse; never
default a field.

(b) **Do not add the `bastrop_tx` grant yet.** A grant pointing at a route the dashboards cannot reach
would put a failing fetch on the product. The grant is the last step, after D-13 and D-14, and it goes
in your `leave_behind`.

(c) Fix the city default. `src/server.mjs` in the finance lens route falls back to `template-city` when
no `cityKey` is passed. Make a missing `cityKey` a REFUSAL, proven by violation. Then enumerate every
other place in `smartcity-dashboards` that defaults a `cityKey` to `template-city`, and list them in
your close; the preamble's rule 3 applies to all of them. Fix only the finance route. The others are a
finding, not scope.

### What proves it

Prove the v2 change on the non-production DigitalOcean app `d12-main-uat` against `bastrop_tx`, and read
back `services[0].source_commit_hash` (OPS-25 rule 13). **If you have no DigitalOcean credential, stop at
merged and say so.** The G-156 lane hit exactly that, and a merged change is not a proven one.

### Close

Declare your `leave_behind`: at least the `bastrop_tx` grant, owned by whoever lands after D-13 and
D-14. File CP1 (the key proof), CP2 and the close.

Your close records: the STEP 0 read verbatim with the key length only; the unmerged-branch finding;
every route's refusal in both directions; the adapter shape validated against the real record; the
city-default fix proven by violation; and every other `template-city` default you found.

State your snapshot in your first output: repository, branch, commit, for both repos.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-18_g159-finance-bridge_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-18_g159-finance-bridge_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-18_g159-finance-bridge_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "g159-finance-bridge",
    "planRows": ["G-159"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "...",
    "subAgents": { "spawned": <int>, "maxDepth": <int> }
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
  subAgents is required and honest: spawned counts every sub-agent this lane launched, maxDepth
  is the deepest level reached (0 when none), and neither may exceed FAN-DEPTH 0.
