CANON-PREAMBLE v9e22f2c4
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v79be86e2 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

PLAN-ROW: G-132 (90_operations/OPS-17_govtech_stack_plan_of_record.md)
repo: smartcity-dashboards

CLAIM YOUR LANE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE. This dispatch may have been handed to
more than one session. Run this FIRST, from the doc_repo worktree you are rooted in:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs claim --lane g132-staff-auth --seat <your-seat-id> --plan-row G-132 --dispatch _dispatches/2026-09-14_g132-staff-auth_dispatch.md

Exit 0 means proceed. **Exit 3 means another seat is already executing this lane:
STAND DOWN, do not execute, and report which seat holds it.** Exit 4 means the claim
is stale — confirm the holder is gone before re-running with --force. Release when
your close is filed:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs release --lane g132-staff-auth --seat <your-seat-id>

On 2026-09-14 this exact dispatch shape was handed to two sessions at once. One found
out mid-execution from a merged commit appearing in its own fetch.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-17 govtech stack (Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, ICC demo)

You are working a lane of OPS-17. The rulings below were standing decisions in the shared
preamble until 2026-09-11; they are program law and moved here so lanes in other programs stop
carrying them. Each still binds every OPS-17 lane. If this section conflicts with the general
canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it conflicts with the AGENT
CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — template Dashboards UI first, then one adapter/source onto `template-city`. Live Bastrop is an island, not the next card. Three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU. Feeds are adapters that write records. Destination still `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_then_bastrop_onboarding.md`. Next-card sequence `_decisions/2026-08-17_dashboards_ui_then_one_feed.md`. Gap map `_inbox/2026-08-17_dashboards_missing_pieces.md`.
- FEED ADAPTER CONTRACT (G-63 CLOSED) — kinds are a catalog; grants are per city pack. Write spine or files with provenance. Never a Dashboards vendor table. Never Pipedrive as a city feed. Samsara fleet copies are not G-24. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g63_feed_adapter_contract.md`.
- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant. Identified caller is a Hauska product key whose `jurisdiction_tenant` equals `cityKey`. `DASHBOARDS_API_KEY` is not a tenant. Fixture pack `fixture-city`. Not sprint-54 done. Not live ingest. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g11_tenancy_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g11_city_pack_tenancy.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g11_close.json`.
- G-45 SMARTSITE STAFF MAP (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards staff map is the SmartSite embed of gold `48021:34137`. GET `/` auto-loads it. Do not cut live Leaflet. Do not clone PE. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g45_smartsite_staff_map_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g45_smartsite_staff_map.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g45_close.json`.
- G-64 LANE C STAFF PATH (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards development-services mounts plan-review-app. GET `/?lens=development-services` auto-loads it. GET `/` stays G-45 SmartSite. Do not cut live PermitFlow. Do not start G-52. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g64_lane_c_staff_path_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g64_lane_c_staff_path.md`.

- COMPASS IS SHARED-ELEMENT SHEET CHROME — G-66 item. Top-bar source control, not a page, not a rail-only assistant. Answer engine is out of this wave. Old Compass is not the atom-render reference; SmartSite is. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_ux_implementation_sequence.md`.
- UX IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (G-67 first) — kit copy, then G-66 / G-68 / G-69 in parallel. Those three CLOSED 2026-08-17. G-24 stays zero. Live Bastrop no-touch.
- FILES COMPOSE THEN ONE FEED (G-70 G-71 G-72 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Work → Files mounts smart-files-app. G-71 wrote Bastrop municode meetings onto `template-city` files. That host is a HOLD (identity collapse), not a feed win. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_files_compose_then_one_feed.md`.
- SHELL BEFORE FEEDS (G-73 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Every G-18 / live-Bastrop staff function has a named home on the Dashboards shell. Connections is 67 of 67 Homes-table rows. Assets honest-empty. Feeds still pause. Register `_inbox/2026-08-17_g18_shell_homes.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_shell_before_feeds.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g73_shell_homes_WDLL.md`.

Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g74_close.json`.
- DEMO-CITY CHROME (G-75 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — mounts fill the frame, one SmartSite iframe, Compass-class map motion from current rails, 30c screens honest-empty. Serving `00013-vkl`. Plan Review `embed=1` is Dashboards-side; host already had detection. Interruptibility partial. Register 67 of 67 plus 3 addenda. Note `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g75_close.json`. Handoff `_inbox/2026-08-17_demo_city_template_handoff.md`.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT-LINE DESIGN SYSTEM — one Empressa kit governs Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, and future Asset Management. Not a Dashboards-only theme. Not Hauska chrome. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_design_system.md`.
- SMARTCITY VISUAL LAW (session 1, operator loved 2026-08-17) — quiet surfaces, loud exceptions, honest absence. Register not card deck. Sidebar. Inverted applicability (Pass quiet, Unchecked hatch). Inter + Plex Mono, 12px floor. Environment badge. Not-built nav. Provenance chip; no bare confidence. Code citation has no ICC body slot. Light `--sc-atom` `#177F78`, dark `#4CC9C0`. Kit extract `_inbox/2026-08-17_sc_kit.css`. Decisions `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_visual_law.md` and `_decisions/2026-08-17_atom_accent_light_hex.md`.
- SMARTCITY DASHBOARDS HOUSING — one product repo `empressaioemail-tech/smartcity-dashboards`, cities as tenant packs. Live Bastrop stays `smartcity-os` until a named island replacement. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_dashboards_housing.md`.


# MISSION — G-132: staff authentication, a person not a persona

Do NOT spawn sub-agents. You are the deepest worker; do the work yourself.

## What is true today, verified

No product in this portfolio can identify an individual.

`smartcity-dashboards` resolves which **city** a request is for and never which **person**.
`plan-review` and `smart-files` each carry exactly ONE Bastrop persona, literally labelled
"Development services staff", that every staff member of every department would share. The two
routes serving PII-bearing data (`/api/domains/:id`, `/api/city-domains`) are gated on city-tenant
membership alone.

That was established by G-127, which returned **blocked** rather than building a role layer with
nothing to attach a role to. Read `_inbox/2026-09-14_g127-rbac_close.json` first — it has the
source lines.

**Consequence the operator needs delivered, not just built:** "give Bastrop staff logins"
currently means handing every department one shared account. This row is what makes that
sentence true.

## The ruling you are implementing

`_decisions/2026-09-14_staff_identity_and_department_rbac.md`, ruling 1, **amended twice on the
day it was made**. Read the record, not a summary — both reversals matter and the reasoning is
load-bearing.

> **SmartCity admin provisions every staff account and issues the credentials.** No city IT, no
> city-manager invites, no self-registration. A managed provider holds the credentials so we never
> store password hashes for a government customer, but every user is created and every role
> assigned by us through its admin API.

**What was tried and rejected, so you do not re-propose either.** SSO against the city's identity
system was the first ruling and was reversed on the principle *"we should not be asking cities to
configure anything"* — SSO requires them to register an application, which is a configuration ask
however it is framed, and it breaks the cost-per-jurisdiction commitment. Domain-restricted magic
link with city-manager invites was the second proposal and was reversed because an invite UI is
still a thing a customer has to learn and operate.

**The city does nothing.** That is the test. If any part of your design requires an action by
anyone at Bastrop — IT, the city manager, or a staff member beyond signing in with credentials we
gave them — it fails the ruling.

## What to build

**Use a managed provider's admin API. Do not build auth.** "We control the users" does not mean
"we store credentials." The provider holds password hashes, reset flows and MFA; we hold the
admin authority. Turn self-registration OFF — every account exists because we created it.

**MFA on.** These accounts reach citizen names, phone numbers and complaint addresses.

**One identity, three products.** A staff member signs in once and is the same person in
`smartcity-dashboards`, `plan-review` and `smart-files`. If your design produces three
integrations, stop and report — avoiding that is why this is one row.

**Carry a `role` claim.** G-127 reads it. The vocabulary is the nine lenses per ruling 2; you are
not defining roles here, but the claim must exist and be readable so G-127 is not blocked a second
time on the shape of the token.

**Reach the MCP surface.** If identity stops at the UI, the door around it is open. Establish how
the MCP path receives the same identity, or name it as an explicit gap with its consequence
stated.

**Fail closed.** No identity, unknown issuer, expired or malformed token: refuse. Never fall back
to the shared persona and never fall back to tenant-only resolution — that is the exact state this
row removes.

**Typed refusals.** A refused request says it was refused and why. A silent empty response is
indistinguishable from "no records".

## Two operational obligations the ruling creates — build the surface for them

The ruling accepts a known cost knowingly, and your job is to make it operable rather than to
re-argue it.

**Offboarding is now OURS.** Under SSO it was automatic. Under this, the city tells us someone
left and we act. That needs a real path: a documented way to disable an account and an instrument
that shows it took effect across all three products. **Verify by violation** — disable an account,
confirm access ends in all three, confirm a live account still works.

**Sylvia must be able to SEE who has access without managing it.** The **People and access** lens
already exists in the nav marked NOT BUILT. Make it the access review surface: **read-only for the
city manager, administered by us.** She sees everyone with access to her city's data at any time.
This is the reconciliation the ruling names explicitly; it is in scope.

## The anonymous path is load-bearing — do not break it

`template-city` is public-free and must keep serving anonymously. An anonymous caller currently
gets fixtures on `template-city` and 401 on every `bastrop_tx` route. **Both halves must still be
true afterwards, and you verify both**, not just that signed-in users get in.

Establish what data exists under the current anonymous or shared-persona path and what happens to
it when real identities arrive. If a claim flow is needed, name it — do not silently strand
records nobody can reach any more.

## Method

**Verify by violation, both directions.** Disable an upstream account and confirm access ends in
all three products; confirm a valid account still works. A control observed only permitting has
not been observed working.

Pre-register the falsifier before each check.

ENUMERATE BEFORE ASSERTING ABSENCE. Say what you searched.

State the mechanism explaining an observation, then a second mechanism that would produce the same
observation and why you rejected it.

**Never print secret VALUES.** Env var names only. This row handles credentials; that rule is not
decorative here.

Every verification command exit-bounded (`timeout 120 ...`).

## If this needs an operator ruling, stop and say so

The mechanism is ruled. The provider choice within that class, and anything about cost, is not.
If you hit a decision the ruling does not cover — pricing tier, where identities are stored, what
happens to a staff member we provision who maps to no lens role — **name it and stop**
rather than choosing. An identity model chosen by an agent and discovered later is worse than a
day of delay.

## Close

Deploys are planner-owned: you deploy and you fix your own failed deploys. Canary with
`--no-traffic`, smoke, shift, verify by reading the traffic JSON **by field name**.

Write your close to the path named in the CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE block above — that is the
machine-checkable one, and this mission deliberately does not name a second.

State: the offboarding violation test in both directions across all three products; the
documented path for disabling an account and the instrument that shows it took effect; how the
MCP surface receives identity or why it does not; the anonymous `template-city` path verified
still working in both directions; what happened to any pre-existing anonymous or shared-persona
data; and confirmation that NOTHING in your design requires an action by anyone at Bastrop.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-14_g132-staff-auth_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-14_g132-staff-auth_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-14_g132-staff-auth_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "g132-staff-auth",
    "planRows": ["G-132"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "..."
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
