CANON-PREAMBLE v9e22f2c4
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v79be86e2 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-17 govtech stack (Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, ICC demo)

You are working a lane of OPS-17. The rulings below were standing decisions in the shared
preamble until 2026-09-11; they are program law and moved here so lanes in other programs stop
carrying them. Each still binds every OPS-17 lane. If this section conflicts with the general
canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it conflicts with the AGENT
CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — template Dashboards UI first, then one adapter/source onto `template-city`. Live Bastrop is an island, not the next card. Three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU. Feeds are adapters that write records. Destination still `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_then_bastrop_onboarding.md`. Next-card sequence `_decisions/2026-08-17_dashboards_ui_then_one_feed.md`. Gap map `_inbox/2026-08-17_dashboards_missing_pieces.md`.
- FEED ADAPTER CONTRACT (G-63 CLOSED) — kinds are a catalog; grants are per city pack. Write spine or files with provenance. Never a Dashboards vendor table. Never Pipedrive as a city feed. Samsara fleet copies are not G-24. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g63_feed_adapter_contract.md`.
- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant. Identified caller is a Hauska product key whose `jurisdiction_tenant` equals `cityKey`. `DASHBOARDS_API_KEY` is not a tenant. Fixture pack `fixture-city`. Not sprint-54 done. Not live ingest. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g11_tenancy_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g11_city_pack_tenancy.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g11_close.json`.
- G-45 SMARTSITE STAFF MAP (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards staff map is the SmartSite embed of gold `48021:34137`. GET `/` auto-loads it. Do not cut live Leaflet. Do not clone PE. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g45_smartsite_staff_map_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g45_smartsite_staff_map.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g45_close.json`.
- G-64 LANE C STAFF PATH (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards development-services mounts plan-review-app. GET `/?lens=development-services` auto-loads it. GET `/` stays G-45 SmartSite. Do not cut live PermitFlow. Do not start G-52. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g64_lane_c_staff_path_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g64_lane_c_staff_path.md`.

- G-65 PERMITFLOW KILL (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — PermitFlow dead as a Dashboards product. Live `/permitflow/*` uncut until a named island replacement. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g65_permitflow_kill_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g65_permitflow_kill.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g65_close.json`.
- COMPASS IS SHARED-ELEMENT SHEET CHROME — G-66 item. Top-bar source control, not a page, not a rail-only assistant. Answer engine is out of this wave. Old Compass is not the atom-render reference; SmartSite is. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_ux_implementation_sequence.md`.
- UX IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (G-67 first) — kit copy, then G-66 / G-68 / G-69 in parallel. Those three CLOSED 2026-08-17. G-24 stays zero. Live Bastrop no-touch.
- FILES COMPOSE THEN ONE FEED (G-70 G-71 G-72 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Work → Files mounts smart-files-app. G-71 wrote Bastrop municode meetings onto `template-city` files. That host is a HOLD (identity collapse), not a feed win. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_files_compose_then_one_feed.md`.
- SHELL BEFORE FEEDS (G-73 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Every G-18 / live-Bastrop staff function has a named home on the Dashboards shell. Connections is 67 of 67 Homes-table rows. Assets honest-empty. Feeds still pause. Register `_inbox/2026-08-17_g18_shell_homes.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_shell_before_feeds.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g73_shell_homes_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g73_close.json`.
- TEMPLATE-CITY IDENTITY (G-74 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — municode grant pulled off template-city. Compose meetings empty with basis `no municode calendar grant on template-city`. Citizen has no Chestnut. Connections HTML has zero Bastrop. No clerk retarget. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_template_city_identity.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g74_identity_leak_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g74_close.json`.
- DEMO-CITY CHROME (G-75 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — mounts fill the frame, one SmartSite iframe, Compass-class map motion from current rails, 30c screens honest-empty. Serving `00013-vkl`. Plan Review `embed=1` is Dashboards-side; host already had detection. Interruptibility partial. Register 67 of 67 plus 3 addenda. Note `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g75_close.json`. Handoff `_inbox/2026-08-17_demo_city_template_handoff.md`.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT-LINE DESIGN SYSTEM — one Empressa kit governs Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, and future Asset Management. Not a Dashboards-only theme. Not Hauska chrome. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_design_system.md`.
- SMARTCITY VISUAL LAW (session 1, operator loved 2026-08-17) — quiet surfaces, loud exceptions, honest absence. Register not card deck. Sidebar. Inverted applicability (Pass quiet, Unchecked hatch). Inter + Plex Mono, 12px floor. Environment badge. Not-built nav. Provenance chip; no bare confidence. Code citation has no ICC body slot. Light `--sc-atom` `#177F78`, dark `#4CC9C0`. Kit extract `_inbox/2026-08-17_sc_kit.css`. Decisions `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_visual_law.md` and `_decisions/2026-08-17_atom_accent_light_hex.md`.
- SMARTCITY DASHBOARDS HOUSING — one product repo `empressaioemail-tech/smartcity-dashboards`, cities as tenant packs. Live Bastrop stays `smartcity-os` until a named island replacement. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_dashboards_housing.md`.


# MISSION — plan-review intake + ICC linkage recon (READ-ONLY)

Do NOT spawn sub-agents. You are the deepest worker; do the work yourself.

READ-ONLY. Do NOT write, edit, commit, push, or modify ANY file in ANY product repository.
Do not run npm/pnpm install or any build. Do not check out, pull, reset, or alter repo state.
Your ONLY write is your report file named at the end of this mission.

## CRITICAL: the working tree is stale

Primary repo: `/p/plan-review` (GitHub empressaioemail-tech/plan-review).
The local working tree is **16 commits BEHIND** origin/main. Reading it gives WRONG answers.

Read the authoritative ref, each command bounded by `timeout 120`:
  timeout 120 git -C /p/plan-review log origin/main --oneline | head -60
  timeout 120 git -C /p/plan-review grep -n <pattern> origin/main
  timeout 120 git -C /p/plan-review show origin/main:<path>

origin/main is at `1af5ac5` (2026-09-02). Declare repo, ref and commit SHA in your first output line.

Secondary repos you may also read under the same rules: `/p/icc-demo`, `/p/icc-portal`.
Check each against its remote before trusting the working tree (`timeout 120 git -C <repo> fetch origin`
is allowed since it does not alter the working tree; nothing else that writes).

## Context

`plan-review` is a net-new product: AI-assisted building plan review producing a Pass/Fail/Unchecked
determination on a submittal, checked against code sections with structured citations. Multi-tenant
by persona. A real Bastrop persona `bastrop_tx` went live 2026-09-02 with cross-tenant read AND write
refusal verified both directions.

Two canon claims you must VERIFY against source rather than repeat back:
- Only TWO sections of the Bastrop UDC are real: `14-02-003` and `14-02-008`, in edition
  `bastrop_tx-bdc-2026-adopted` / book `BASTROP-UDC`.
- ICC content (IBC 2018, ~4,825 atoms) is licensed under a signed ICC contract and is reachable.
  A defect was fixed 2026-09-02 in `/api/plan-review/code` where payload extraction used `atom.data`
  instead of `atom.data.atom`.

Two things being planned depend on this report:
(a) Getting a Bastrop permit from their vendor system (MyGov) INTO plan review for a test review,
    WITHOUT disturbing their existing workflow.
(b) Verifying plan review is "linking appropriately with the ICC demo".

## Establish, with evidence

1. INTAKE. How does a submittal enter plan review today? Trace the full path end to end. File upload?
   API? What creates an engagement/project/case? Required fields? Name files, routes, functions; quote code.
2. MINIMUM VIABLE INPUT. Does a determination REQUIRE an uploaded document (drawings/PDF), or can it run
   on metadata alone? Answer explicitly either way. This decides whether a permit record with no
   attachments is useful at all.
3. DETERMINATION PIPELINE. How does a submittal become a Pass/Fail/Unchecked matrix? `matrixFromChain`,
   `buildCitation` and `code-lookup.mjs` have been referenced. Explain the real flow and where code
   sections get resolved.
4. EDITION AND CODE-BOOK WIRING. How are `AVAILABLE_EDITIONS` and `CODE_BOOKS` defined? Verify the
   two-real-sections claim. Verify which IBC/IPMC books are wired and whether each has a live query path
   to real content. Quote the actual definitions.
5. ICC LINKAGE, IN DETAIL — this is a priority. How does plan review reach ICC content? MCP server,
   REST route, direct DB read? Is there an entitlement or license gate, and what happens on an
   unentitled request? Read `/p/icc-demo` and `/p/icc-portal` for the other side. NOTE a commit
   `fix(g60): remove plan-review /icc middleware` suggests the linkage changed shape at least once.
   Establish the CURRENT shape, not the historical one.
6. TENANCY AND PERSONAS. How are personas defined (`src/actors.mjs` has been referenced)? How is
   `bastrop_tx` registered? How is cross-tenant access refused, and is refusal on BOTH read and write?
   Quote the enforcement code.
7. COVERAGE HONESTY. When a code section is unavailable, what is returned? Verify it is TYPED ABSENCE
   rather than a silent gap or a fabricated pass. Quote the code that does this. Honest refusal is a
   requirement here, not a nice-to-have.
8. EXTENSION POINTS. Given intake as it exists, what would it take to accept a permit record (number,
   address, type, applicant, possibly attached documents) pulled from an external vendor system and
   start a review from it? Name the specific functions and routes that would change, and flag whatever
   makes this hard.

## Method requirements

- ENUMERATE BEFORE ASSERTING ABSENCE. Say what you searched.
- State the mechanism explaining an observation, THEN a second mechanism that would produce the same
  observation and why you rejected it.
- Quote real code with real paths and line numbers from the origin/main ref.
- Verify the two canon claims against source. If canon is WRONG, say so plainly with evidence.
- Never print secret VALUES. Env var names only.
- Every verification command must be exit-bounded (`timeout 120 ...`). Never run a command that waits
  for input or does not terminate.

## Close

Write your report to `_inbox/2026-09-14_g52_planreview_intake_icc.md`.
Lead with a short executive summary: how a submittal gets in, what the minimum input is, whether ICC
linkage currently works, and what it would take to feed in an external permit. Then the numbered
sections. End with "What I could not determine and why".

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-14_g52-planreview-icc_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-14_g52-planreview-icc_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-14_g52-planreview-icc_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "g52-planreview-icc",
    "planRows": ["G-52"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "..."
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
