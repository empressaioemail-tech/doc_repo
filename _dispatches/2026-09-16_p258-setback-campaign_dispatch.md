CANON-PREAMBLE v3a99388a
- COTALITY REST IS DEAD, THE VENDOR IS RE-ENGAGED FOR THE FARM (operator 2026-09-16, _decisions/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_sequence_and_four_rulings.md): when code hits Cotality REST (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record and NEVER rotate the credential. The MCP eval channel is live for internal evaluation only. No vendor-sourced value reaches a customer until the commercial agreement is read, and the factory never bulk-calls the vendor. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v378cd643 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

PLAN-ROW: P-258 (90_operations/OPS-16_texas_market_plan_of_record.md)
repo: legacy-design-tools
FAN-DEPTH: 1
This lane may launch sub-agents one level deep; those sub-agents launch none. The commit gate refuses a close that declares a deeper fan (A-181).

CLAIM YOUR LANE BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ELSE. This dispatch may have been handed to
more than one session. Run this FIRST, from the doc_repo worktree you are rooted in:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs claim --lane p258-setback-campaign --seat <your-seat-id> --plan-row P-258 --dispatch _dispatches/2026-09-16_p258-setback-campaign_dispatch.md

Exit 0 means proceed. **Exit 3 means another seat is already executing this lane:
STAND DOWN, do not execute, and report which seat holds it.** Exit 4 means the claim
is stale — confirm the holder is gone before re-running with --force. Release when
your close is filed:

  node scripts/lane-claim.mjs release --lane p258-setback-campaign --seat <your-seat-id>

On 2026-09-14 this exact dispatch shape was handed to two sessions at once. One found
out mid-execution from a merged commit appearing in its own fetch.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-24 county to serving

You are working a lane of OPS-24. Everything below is program law for this lane. If it
conflicts with the general canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it
conflicts with the AGENT CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

## The one goal

A county goes from "not in the product" to "a customer types a real address in that county
and the card, the MCP and the PDF agree, and every value carries its source and vintage"
through ONE pipeline of thirteen stages, each with a predicate that can fail and an instrument
that measures it, at a cost the kill test can read. Not "acquire everything". The sequence is
ruled (operator 2026-09-16, `_decisions/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_sequence_and_four_rulings.md`,
scope `_inbox/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_program_scope.md`):

1. **Phase 0:** the six onboarded counties complete and verified.
2. **Phase 1:** Burnet with its cities as the first county through the farm, with the farm built
   and refined during that run.
3. **Phase 2:** Bell and Milam through the farm in parallel.
4. **Then** the rest of Texas.

## Six laws

1. **The customer predicate is the definition of done.** `scripts/surface-probe.mjs` with a
   real address in the county is the finish line for every stage, not stage 12's private
   check. A stage that cannot be traced to a change in what the probe reads is not on this
   program. ARMED 2026-09-14 on the enforcement side: `probe-close-gate.mjs` gates every
   OPS-24 row and prints the predicate debt on each close until `surface-probe.mjs` carries
   the stage's row (P-197); a close with neither an artifact nor a declared
   `probe.notApplicable` (read-only reviews only) is refused. **A store-reading instrument is
   never the customer predicate** (A-183): the factory-store and atoms-store instruments were
   green through the whole 2026-09-15 map incident. The probe's OPS-24 legs are P-254.
2. **The gate is fixed before anything trusts it. Three things are called "the gate"; know
   which one you are touching (A-183).**
   - **The publish refusal** is `requirePreBakeReadiness` (factory
     `src/lib/publish-readiness-gate.mjs`, called by the publish job): a population check, then
     `evaluatePreBakeReadiness` over the publish-floor rails' verdicts.
   - **The rail verdicts** are `evaluateRailGate`, written hourly to `parcel_gate_verdict` by
     `publish-gate-sched.mjs` and labelled by P-201's `classifyExclusion`.
   - **`evaluatePublishGate` and `assertPublishableCounty` have no production caller.** Do not
     cite them as a control.
   - **Fixed:** P-195 closed the ZERO-ROW case (`RAIL_NEVER_FILLED`,
     `BAKE_POPULATION_UNMEASURED`).
   - **Still open, measured by violation 2026-09-16 after P-201 merged:** the ZERO-EARNED case.
     A county whose 65 rails all hold `unaccounted` cells gets `excluded-not-applicable` on
     every rail (basis `LIVE_ELSEWHERE`), and the pre-bake rail check clears it because it tests
     only `verdict === "refuse"`. **P-252 closes it, proven by a checked-in fixture that must
     REFUSE, before any new county's verdict is trusted.**
3. **One county at a time until the farm is proven** (rewritten 2026-09-16 to the operator's
   sequence).
   - Burnet is the first county through the farm. The farm's machinery (manifest, pre-bake
     audit, completeness check, stage meter, merge gate) is built and refined during that run,
     and every defect Burnet finds is fixed upstream, never in the county.
   - Burnet runs on the shared stores with full stage telemetry (A-180).
   - Bell and Milam then run in parallel. Whether they need isolated stores is decided from
     Burnet's measured stage records, not in advance.
   - The fleet has learned twice that blockers surface serially; one county finds them faster
     than a wave does.
4. **Three operator stop points, and only three:** a new credential or secret mount, a write
   to a production serving store, a ruling. Everything else runs unattended and leaves a
   record naming what it touched.
5. **Every stage meters itself.** Compute dollars and operator minutes per county per stage
   go on the stage's run record, so commitment 3 (under 200 dollars and one hour per county)
   can fire as a kill, not a slogan. **As of 2026-09-16 nothing records either** (no column,
   table or writer at factory `9171279`); P-284 builds it and Burnet does not start without it.
6. **Nothing is measured once and published as state.** A number on this program's card
   names its SHA and its date. OPS-23's live card is authoritative where the two programs
   touch (serving, identity, the ledger).

## Identity and vintage, inherited as law

The OPS-21 identity paragraph applies: `place_key` is the parcel-map id; in a two-namespace
county the account joins only through the published crosswalk; never by bare number. The
P-178 vintage rule applies: a county's declared roll is a decision with a marker for accounts
that fall off, never an upsert that keeps notice values silently.

## Out of scope until after Phase 2 (A-177)

The road-node pass: a TIGER cross-check, a street-name dictionary, classification rules, and the
`roads` and `edgeSignal` ledger rails. Study road data only where it blocks envelope or footprint
rendering, and say exactly where. **The measurement of "blocks rendering" is P-264's per-city
residual** (the verification re-derive runs in Phase 0 without the road-name dictionary);
a city whose residual is dominated by road failures comes back to the operator for a ruling.

## The Phase 0 exit (scope rev 4, section 5)

One definition, all legs at once: the ledger leg (`six-county-completeness.mjs`, repaired by
P-253), the customer leg (`surface-probe.mjs` over the 39-bucket fixture list, P-254), the
coverage leg (P-210), the road residual (P-264), and the operator's walk. **Burnet's run waits
on it, and the long pole is the setback acquisition campaign (P-258), not the gate rows.** The
farm machinery builds in parallel.

## Traps the final teardown found (A-183); read before touching these surfaces

- The depth-warm wire field is `depthWarmPromotion === "depth-warm-promoted-v1"` (with a
  `sourceCitation` fallback), not `depthWarmPromoted`. Four predicates read this fact in three
  repos; a change to one carries a divergence test against the others.
- `unaccounted` does not refuse on every surface. LDT's dollar rails keep the legacy value and
  `valueBasis` defaults a label (P-269). A write that flips cells to `unaccounted` names its rail
  allowlist.
- The 2026-09-15 blank map was a stale browser tab after a rollback, not a one-branch server
  regression (A-157). A staging proof records the serving build by asset existence, never by
  `Age:`, and measures from a fresh browser context.
- A buildable-area figure appears only when a VERIFIED envelope atom backs it (A-180). The MCP
  payload and the PDF do not enforce that today (P-249, P-261).
- The doc_repo commit gates do not fire in a seat worktree or on a merge until P-280 lands.
  Declare `subAgents` and the probe honestly anyway; the integration seat re-grades on landing.
- Bell already serves from the July bake (165,574 rows). It is a migration county (P-291).

## What this program absorbs

OPS-21's unfinished writers (stage 6), OPS-23's serving seams (stages 10 and 11), P-124's bake
(stages 9 and 10), P-156 (stage 0), P-181 (stages 2 and 9), P-182 (stage 0), P-184 (stage 4).
Each absorbed row keeps its number and its close history; OPS-24 rows name what they absorb.


## Mission — P-258: the setback acquisition campaign (a planner wave)

**FAN-DEPTH 1.** You are a wave planner. You may launch sub-agent lanes, one level deep; your
lanes launch none. Keep the wave to six lanes or fewer. You own the fan: every lane you launch
reports to you, you read each lane's diff and evidence yourself, and you do not end your turn
while a lane is still running (poll with a bounded loop; no notification will arrive).

### The goal

Every zoned (city, district) unit in the six counties has its dimensional table on file in the
setback corpus, verbatim, with a citation and an effective date read at source; every city is
classified; and every unit that cannot be acquired carries a signed, sourced
declared-unacquirable note. This is the longest task before Burnet (scope rev 4 section 12).

### The worklist (measured, not estimated)

Read `_inbox/2026-09-16_setback_parcel_census.json` (P-255, live run 2026-09-16T18:15Z) and
`_inbox/2026-09-16_texas_scaleup_program_scope.md` section 2b and section 4.1.

- **Half A, district misses in wired cities:** the `districtMissCodes` entries whose
  `plannedDevelopment` is false: **209 (city, code) units, 63,487 parcels.** Largest first:
  Austin SF-4A (15,664), Austin CS (4,111), Austin SF-6 (2,951), then Waco O-2, C-3, M-2, C-2,
  O-3, Round Rock, Leander, Kyle, Cedar Park, Hutto, Bastrop.
- **Half B, the 54 no-table cities (94,260 parcels):** the `noTableCities` lists, McLennan
  heaviest (19 cities, 33,139 parcels), then Travis (17), Williamson (8), Hays (8), Caldwell (6),
  Bastrop (3).
- **Out of scope for this wave:** the 61,725 planned-development parcels (PUD, PDD, PD, PC); A-164
  answers them with the PUD message (P-256, P-257). Austin's source layer and base-code parser
  (the `CS` versus `CS-1` problem) are P-259; you may add Austin table rows, but do not change
  the Austin zoning adapter.

Suggested lanes (adjust to what you find, and say why):
1. Austin district tables (Travis and Williamson parts).
2. Waco and the other McLennan district misses.
3. The other wired-city district misses (Round Rock, Leander, Kyle, Cedar Park, Hutto, Bastrop,
   Lockhart, Buda, Dripping Springs, San Marcos, Pflugerville).
4. McLennan's 19 no-table cities.
5. Travis's 17 no-table cities.
6. The remaining no-table cities (Williamson, Hays, Caldwell, Bastrop), plus Smithville under
   the eCode360 scrape ruling and Lockhart's replacement source or declared-unacquirable note.

### The rules every lane follows

1. **Classify each city** as one of four:
   - (1) zoned with a staged layer;
   - (2a) zoned, with an undocumented queryable endpoint to find;
   - (2b) zoned, with a map published only as a PDF;
   - (3) unzoned.

   A public-source sample of seven found six zoned, so expect category 3 to be rare.
2. **Per (city, district) unit, four steps:**
   - locate the governing instrument and its effective date at source (most-current-wins,
     `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`; an unreadable date is a
     conflict row, never a pick);
   - determine what the official map is;
   - find the endpoint, or fail and record the sources tried;
   - extract the table verbatim with its citation and date: front, side, rear, corner, height,
     coverage, footprint.
3. **The work lands as legacy-design-tools PRs** against `lib/adapters/src/local/setbacks/` and
   `@empressaio/setback-corpus`, following the existing file shape, with the corpus's own
   row-verification step. One PR per lane. No lane merges or deploys.
4. **Never fabricate.**
   - A code that is not in the ordinance is a note, not a row.
   - A category-3 city is a declaration for P-156, not a table.
   - Two-letter codes are real districts somewhere: Austin's RR is Rural Residence.
5. **"Not found" lists every source tried**: Municode, eCode360, American Legal, the city's
   document centre, and an ArcGIS REST search.
6. **No store writes.** The factory writer re-run that turns these rows into cells comes after
   P-256, and the integration seat runs it.

### Your wave artifact

`_inbox/<date>_p258_worklist.json` on your seat branch: one entry per city and per unit, with
category, instrument, effective date, endpoint result, state (acquired | declared-unacquirable |
blocked), PR, and the sources tried. The integration seat re-runs P-255's census after the
writer run; the census is the grade.

### Falsifiers, pre-register your answers first

1. Every one of the 209 units and 54 cities appears in the worklist with a state; none is
   silently missing.
2. Every acquired row cites an instrument and an effective date read at source.
3. No planned-development code gets a Euclidean table row.

### Close

Snapshot per repo; the worklist; each lane's PR with its CI conclusion strings; counts by state;
`subAgents` (spawned, maxDepth 1). `status`: `closed-partial` until the PRs merge and the writer
re-run shows the census moving. `probe`: `{"notApplicable": "acquisition wave; graded by the
census after the writer run"}`. `leave_behind`.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-16_p258-setback-campaign_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-16_p258-setback-campaign_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-16_p258-setback-campaign_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "p258-setback-campaign",
    "planRows": ["P-258"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "...",
    "subAgents": { "spawned": <int>, "maxDepth": <int> }
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
  subAgents is required and honest: spawned counts every sub-agent this lane launched, maxDepth
  is the deepest level reached (0 when none), and neither may exceed FAN-DEPTH 1.
