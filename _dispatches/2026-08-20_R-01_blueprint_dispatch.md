CANON-PREAMBLE v6c68a963

- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HELD until Bastrop QA-done + operator go.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT LINE THEN UI THEN ONE FEED — template Dashboards UI first, then one adapter/source onto `template-city`. Live Bastrop is an island, not the next card. Three identities: `template-city` demo, live `tenant_id=2` Bastrop, next onboarded city. Do not rewrite `tenant_id=2` in place. CitizenConnect is the citizen lens, not a SKU. Feeds are adapters that write records. Destination still `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_then_bastrop_onboarding.md`. Next-card sequence `_decisions/2026-08-17_dashboards_ui_then_one_feed.md`. Gap map `_inbox/2026-08-17_dashboards_missing_pieces.md`.
- FEED ADAPTER CONTRACT (G-63 CLOSED) — kinds are a catalog; grants are per city pack. Write spine or files with provenance. Never a Dashboards vendor table. Never Pipedrive as a city feed. Samsara fleet copies are not G-24. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g63_feed_adapter_contract.md`.
- G-11 CITY-PACK TENANCY (CLOSED 2026-08-17 as sequencing) — a city pack is the tenant. Identified caller is a Hauska product key whose `jurisdiction_tenant` equals `cityKey`. `DASHBOARDS_API_KEY` is not a tenant. Fixture pack `fixture-city`. Not sprint-54 done. Not live ingest. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g11_tenancy_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g11_city_pack_tenancy.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g11_close.json`.
- G-45 SMARTSITE STAFF MAP (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards staff map is the SmartSite embed of gold `48021:34137`. GET `/` auto-loads it. Do not cut live Leaflet. Do not clone PE. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g45_smartsite_staff_map_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g45_smartsite_staff_map.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g45_close.json`.
- G-64 LANE C STAFF PATH (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Dashboards development-services mounts plan-review-app. GET `/?lens=development-services` auto-loads it. GET `/` stays G-45 SmartSite. Do not cut live PermitFlow. Do not start G-52. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g64_lane_c_staff_path_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g64_lane_c_staff_path.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g64_close.json`. Serving Dashboards `00007-8sc`.
- G-65 PERMITFLOW KILL (CLOSED 2026-08-17) — PermitFlow dead as a Dashboards product. Live `/permitflow/*` uncut until a named island replacement. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g65_permitflow_kill_WDLL.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_g65_permitflow_kill.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_g65_close.json`.
- COMPASS IS SHARED-ELEMENT SHEET CHROME — G-66 item. Top-bar source control, not a page, not a rail-only assistant. Answer engine is out of this wave. Old Compass is not the atom-render reference; SmartSite is. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_ux_implementation_sequence.md`.
- UX IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE (G-67 first) — kit copy, then G-66 / G-68 / G-69 in parallel. Those three CLOSED 2026-08-17. G-24 stays zero. Live Bastrop no-touch.
- FILES COMPOSE THEN ONE FEED (G-70 G-71 G-72 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Work → Files mounts smart-files-app. G-71 wrote Bastrop municode meetings onto `template-city` files. That host is a HOLD (identity collapse), not a feed win. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_files_compose_then_one_feed.md`.
- SHELL BEFORE FEEDS (G-73 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — Every G-18 / live-Bastrop staff function has a named home on the Dashboards shell. Connections is 67 of 67 Homes-table rows. Assets honest-empty. Feeds still pause. Register `_inbox/2026-08-17_g18_shell_homes.md`. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_shell_before_feeds.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g73_shell_homes_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g73_close.json`.
- TEMPLATE-CITY IDENTITY (G-74 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — municode grant pulled off template-city. Compose meetings empty with basis `no municode calendar grant on template-city`. Citizen has no Chestnut. Connections HTML has zero Bastrop. No clerk retarget. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_template_city_identity.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g74_identity_leak_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g74_close.json`.
- DEMO-CITY CHROME (G-75 CLOSED 2026-08-17) — mounts fill the frame, one SmartSite iframe, Compass-class map motion from current rails, 30c screens honest-empty. Serving `00013-vkl`. Plan Review `embed=1` is Dashboards-side; host already had detection. Interruptibility partial. Register 67 of 67 plus 3 addenda. Note `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion.md`. WDLL `_inbox/2026-08-17_g75_shell_mounts_motion_WDLL.md`. Close `_inbox/2026-08-17_b_g75_close.json`. Handoff `_inbox/2026-08-17_demo_city_template_handoff.md`.
- SMARTCITY PRODUCT-LINE DESIGN SYSTEM — one Empressa kit governs Dashboards, Smart Files, Plan Review, and future Asset Management. Not a Dashboards-only theme. Not Hauska chrome. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_product_line_design_system.md`.
- SMARTCITY VISUAL LAW (session 1, operator loved 2026-08-17) — quiet surfaces, loud exceptions, honest absence. Register not card deck. Sidebar. Inverted applicability (Pass quiet, Unchecked hatch). Inter + Plex Mono, 12px floor. Environment badge. Not-built nav. Provenance chip; no bare confidence. Code citation has no ICC body slot. Light `--sc-atom` `#177F78`, dark `#4CC9C0`. Kit extract `_inbox/2026-08-17_sc_kit.css`. Decisions `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_visual_law.md` and `_decisions/2026-08-17_atom_accent_light_hex.md`.
- SMARTCITY DASHBOARDS HOUSING — one product repo `empressaioemail-tech/smartcity-dashboards`, cities as tenant packs. Live Bastrop stays `smartcity-os` until a named island replacement. Decision `_decisions/2026-08-17_smartcity_dashboards_housing.md`.

Preserved from _STATE.md at the 2026-08-20 topology split. Write this file, not the generated combined view. Duplicate branch-protection paragraphs from the concurrent double write were removed; the surviving record is `_state/systems/STATE.md`. The Smart Markets block moved to `_state/markets/STATE.md`.

Single source of truth for WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. Not decisions (those are in memory / _decisions/), not history (those are in _sessions/). Live state a fresh agent picks up from; edit it constantly. **Last updated: 2026-08-20. Property namespace. Restructured from _STATE.md; branch protection lives in _state/systems/STATE.md.**

**LANE B 2026-08-19 (waves 1 and 2 SHIPPED): TEMPLATE CITY BUILD IS RUNNING.** Read `_inbox/2026-08-19_template_city_lens_build_sheet.md` and OPS-17 rows **A-073 to A-079**. **THE CORRECTION THAT OPENED THIS: the G-18 register's `Not built` meant THIS SURFACE DOES NOT EXIST YET, and three agent handoffs hardened it into THIS SURFACE IS MEANT TO BE EMPTY.** Rulings: honest absence is now about SOURCES per region, not screens; the department roster matches live and GROWS; demo data on every lens with one `Demo` chip. Dashboards main **`1b271c8c3dc7bf361c09f00a095cc8e9022a6946`**, serving **`smartcity-dashboards-00025-mam` @100%**, suite **320/320**. Kit main **`17eccfade057c0f8a835b8731be834cd4b828166`**, vocabulary **143**, components **86**, Design project **482** files. **Registry: 11 domains, 10 carrying on `template-city`, 0 of 11 on `empty-city`; `patrol-vehicles` stays the single `ungranted` region on purpose** — granting everything deletes the state that proves ruling 1. Footer now carries two claims: `0 of 10 sources granted` beside `6 of 10 demonstrated with fixture records`. Connections register split to **70 rows / 5 addenda**. **WAVE 3 SHIPPED 2026-08-20** under OPS-17 rows **A-080 to A-084**. Every department lens now renders its domain. Conformance instrument is live and is the reason wave 3 grew: 92 scans over 23 surfaces DERIVED from route definitions (the hand-built list of 16 was 30% short), 0 unwaived nodes, 132 adjudicated, bound stated as JUDGED not CONTAINED. Vertosoft handoff bundle assembled at `P:/tmp/VPAT/vertosoft_handoff_2026-08-20/` (tagged PDFs + CSV, verified against an untagged control). Heads and serving revisions are in the L1/L2 closes, not restated here. **OPEN and dispatchable: G-103 shared tagged-PDF render service, G-104 SmartSite title + glyph fix.** Both compile through `scripts/dispatch.mjs`; a fabricated row refuses. The eleven domains reach no pixel; all fifteen lenses share one `web/index.html` and one unpartitioned `web/shell.css`, so lens rendering merges one at a time. **Open, operator-owed:** Parks and Court are NOT expressible on the seam (four gate points, pinned to go red if a vendorless path appears) and four build-sheet lenses have no vendor — W2DEPT-F2; the register's disposition column is still hand-declared and can drift; the Design picker walk is STILL unrun. Closes `_inbox/2026-08-19_w2ds_close.json`, `_w2dept_close.json`, `_w2fix_close.json`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v92aa194c — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

PLAN-ROW: R-01 (90_operations/OPS-18_canon_reconciliation_plan_of_record.md)

# Canon reconciliation: produce the master blueprint

## Mission — R-01 canon reconciliation, produce the master blueprint

Read `_blueprint/00_WDLL.md` first and in full. It defines done for this row. You are graded
against its seven criteria, not against your own sense of completeness. If you cannot meet a
criterion, say so against that criterion by name rather than producing something adjacent.

Snapshot: doc_repo `54970f3`, branch main. Re-verify with `git rev-parse HEAD` before you
start and declare what you actually got, because this tree moved four times in one hour on
2026-08-20.

### What you are building

`_blueprint/` per the structure in the WDLL: `00_README.md` (the mesh), `10_model.md`,
`20_pipeline.md`, `30_lifecycle.md`, `40_rule_register.md`, `50_grading.md`, `diagrams/`.

### The three things most likely to go wrong, and how

**One. You will treat this as a design exercise. It is a wiring exercise.** Almost nothing
here is missing. The store audit at `_inbox/2026-08-20_store_audit_atom_graph.md` found
`atom_links` built, correctly shaped, indexed four ways, holding 33,066 rows and zero
property edges. It found ten shipped atom-contract fields at zero in production. The
enforcement scripts existed for weeks with no CI. If your blueprint reads as a proposal for
things to build, you have written the wrong document. It should read as a statement of what
correct is, plus a register of which parts of it currently have an executor.

**Two. You will index only markdown.** D1 requires the published
`@empressaio/atom-contract` type surface in the mesh. It is at 1.22.0 on npm, it is not a
document, and it is the only artifact in this estate that refuses to compile, which makes it
the most authoritative thing here. Fetch it (`npm pack @empressaio/atom-contract@1.22.0`)
and read the `.d.ts` surface. Rule explicitly where it disagrees with an ADR. Note that
1.9.0 through 1.22.0 have no ADR at all and `./property`, `./reasoning` and `./testing` are
undocumented subpaths.

**Three. You will resolve the four-way model conflict by picking the nicest wording.** D2
requires a ruling with reasons, on each of the four framings, stating adopted, adopted in
part, or superseded. The disagreement decides where the volatile half of a relation lives.
That is not cosmetic: it is the question that produced 20,844,039 special-district rows
against 13,717,341 parcels. Silence on any of the four is a fail.

### The criterion that decides whether this worked

D4. Take each of V1 through V15 and demonstrate the blueprint FAILS it, naming the rule id,
the section carrying it, and the sentence that fails it. Write the demonstration down.

Where the blueprint cannot fail a violation, do not adjust the blueprint to make it fail.
Record it as a MISSING RULE and file it as an R-04 build item. V10, the factory with no
off-ramp, is expected to land there.

Note the shape of that set before you start: only V2, V4, V6 and V13 are wrong values. The
other eleven are correct artifacts that nothing feeds, nothing reads, or nothing can fail
against. A blueprint tuned to catch bad data will miss two thirds of the list.

### Rules of method

Enumerate the catalog; do not infer structure from the shape of somebody else's query. On
2026-08-20 the planner asserted no link table existed by inferring it from an orphan query.
`atom_links` had been in production the whole time. Distrust your own negative results most.

Absence and starvation look identical from outside and have opposite fixes. Before reporting
anything as missing, check whether it exists and is empty. In this estate, empty is the more
likely answer.

Verify by violating. A check observed only passing has not been observed working. On
2026-08-20 a verification regex compiled to an alternation with an empty branch, matched
every input, and reported success into a commit message.

For every finding, state the second mechanism that would produce the same observation and
why you rejected it.

Pre-register at least two ways your own output could be wrong before you start, and report
the results of those checks whether or not they were favourable.

### Scope fence

No product code. No migrations. No store writes. No new ADRs. No changes to OPS-16 or
OPS-17. Nothing is moved or deleted in this row; quarantine is R-02. No decision is
reversed: where two accepted decisions genuinely conflict, file the conflict for the
operator rather than picking a winner.

### Return

Write `_blueprint/` files in the working tree and leave them uncommitted. Do not `git add`,
commit, push, or open a PR. The planner commits, because that forces reading the artifact.

Return a close naming: the commit you worked at, which of D1 through D7 you met, the D4
demonstration table, every violation you could NOT make the blueprint fail with its proposed
missing rule, and a Tier 2 scratch block at `_scratch/r01_blueprint.md` using LESSON,
DEAD-END, GROUND-TRUTH with timestamps, and OPEN.

End with a `leave_behind:` block. `none` is a valid and cheap answer; the declaration is
required regardless.
