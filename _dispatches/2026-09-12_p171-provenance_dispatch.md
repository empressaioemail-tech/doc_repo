CANON-PREAMBLE v9e22f2c4
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v79be86e2 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-23 surface completion

You are working a lane of OPS-23. Everything below is program law for this lane. If it
conflicts with the general canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it
conflicts with the AGENT CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win. The plan is
`90_operations/OPS-23_surface_completion_program.md`; read sections 2, 3 and 7 before any work.

## The one goal

The Property Explorer panel, the map, the exported PDFs, and the Smart Site MCP connector show
the same facts for the same parcel, from one reader, with honest absences that name the city or
source that is missing. Six Central Texas counties first. **The customer surface is the
predicate.** A merged PR, a cortex read, a ledger count, or an MCP read alone does not close a
lane in this program.

## The five rulings (operator, 2026-09-11) — do not relitigate

- **R-1 MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS.** For setbacks and every dimensional rule, everywhere: the
  source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only when dates
  are equal or unreadable; dates are read from the source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS
  `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; unreadable dates produce a conflict
  row with both values, never a silent pick. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- **R-2 ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED.** The map and the MCP draw block draw the modelled
  buildable envelope from the same call with its disclosure wherever a district and a setback
  table exist. The buildable area number and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs
  them. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- **R-3 THE CITY IS THE UNIT.** Zoning and setback work is scoped per city with a per-city
  predicate. Until a city is done, every absence string names the city.
- **R-4 THE SURFACE PROBE IS THE PREDICATE.** Your close cites a `surface-probe` artifact run
  after your deploy (or, until `scripts/surface-probe.mjs` lands, the raw output of the hand
  probes in OPS-23 §2 pasted verbatim) showing your change on the surface you claim to have
  changed.
- **R-5 THREE ROLES.** You are a lane. You do not commit to doc_repo; you hand artifacts back.
  You may fan one level per AGENT_CONTRACT §1 and verification stays with you.
- **R-6 THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH AND ATOMS ARE CANONICAL.** A node is identity; an atom
  is one claim from one authority at one time; an edge is an atom whose value is a node. A cell
  is accounting: state, atom reference, provenance, and a cached rendering keyed to atom
  version and vocabulary version; a cell never holds a value as canon. One reader in
  `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms; every
  surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy.
  One writer mints atom, pointer and rendering in one transaction. One vocabulary module in
  the atom-contract package. Never add a seventh read path, a second vocabulary, or a cell
  that copies a value. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, OPS-23 §0.

## The probe set — every lane measures on these, and may add one, never remove one

## Facts a lane must carry (verified 2026-09-11; re-verify at source before relying)

- The panel reads facets through hauska-map's own adapter (`api/_lib/pe-property-atoms.ts`,
  `atom-chain-to-facets.ts`), `readPath: atom-chain`, not through cortex node-facets. The
  record-served setback cutover lives in LDT `nodeFacetTier1Assemble.ts` /
  `setbacksFactServeCutover.ts` and reaches `get_smart_site`, not the panel.
- The map draws an envelope only through `ExplorerMap.handleEnvelope`, fed by `InspectCard`
  from the sealed sheet (`fact-sheet-resolver.ts`); the card issues no lookup of its own
  (invariant I2). `sheetEnvelopeIsAtomPathPending` (`fact-sheet-resolver.ts:216-241`) is Ruling
  B's mechanism. `handleEnvelope` also gates drawing on `isEntitled` (Pro, unlocked, dev role);
  that gate is not yours to change.
- `resolveGeometry` (`fact-sheet-resolver.ts:2520-2660`) already accepts `hint.centroid`;
  `ExplorerMap.adoptSubject` passes only `{ geometry }`. The live parcel layer
  (`map-data/gis-layer`) returns the ring for a bbox around `cityLimitsFact.queryPoint`.
- cortex geocoding cannot find "414 SPILLER LN" with or without ", WEST LAKE HILLS, TX"
  (422 `geocode_miss` both ways). Placement must not depend on it.
- The feasibility engine (`hauska-engine-api-00198-cir`) completes Travis refreshes in 85 to
  154 s with 201; PE and smartsite-mcp abort at 55 s; the download endpoint serves the finished
  PDF in 0.2 s afterwards.
- Cell-state vocabulary is OPS-21's (`_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-21.md`). Six states. Use no other.

## What a lane in this program must not do

- Do not mint or backfill envelope atoms; that program resumes when P-152 closes.
- Do not change the entitlement gate or any pricing surface.
- Do not fix a naming mismatch by renaming; report it.
- Do not widen a check to admit a value it does not satisfy; report it.
- Do not read a working tree to verify a deploy; read the serving revision by field name and probe the surface.
- Do not write to a repository your seat does not own; request it from the owning seat via the close.

## Close requirements, in addition to AGENT_CONTRACT §6

- `probe:` the artifact path or the pasted raw output, per R-4.
- `falsifier:` the result you pre-registered that would have proved your change wrong, and what you observed.
- `contradicted:` what in the dispatch or the plan was wrong when you got there. "Nothing" is acceptable and must be said.
- `leave_behind:` per ENFORCEMENT.md.


## Mission — P-171 PROVENANCE: name the writer of the 2026-09-07 building-footprint atoms

You are the deepest worker in OPS-23 wave 2. You do not spawn sub-agents. The dispatch
planner supervises you and reviews your CP1 and CP2. This is an audit row: you read, you do
not write to any store, and you deploy nothing.

Exit-bounded verification: every command you run must terminate on its own; wrap anything
that could hang in `timeout`; never leave a watch, a tail or a dev server running.

### Where you work

`empressaioemail-tech/hauska-engine`, worktree `P:/seat-worktrees/property/hauska-engine-p171-provenance`,
branch `audit/p171-footprint-write-provenance`, from `origin/main`. You will add at most a
script under `scripts/audit/` that reproduces your reads, and nothing else. `P:/hauska-engine`
is someone else's checkout.

### The finding you are closing

`_inbox/2026-09-11_p158-footprint_close.json` (contradicted, item 1; leave_behind): the atoms
store holds 71,501 `building-footprint` atoms for 48021 (24,861 present, 46,640 absence) and
396,462 for 48453 (72,919 present, 323,543 absence), all created 2026-09-07, and the lane found
no matching Cloud Run job execution in that window. An unattributed production write is the
thing ENFORCEMENT.md says a state-changing operation must make impossible. Decision:
`_decisions/2026-09-12_footprint_write_provenance_rowed.md`.

### What you read, in this order, each by field name

1. The atoms themselves: the `createdAt` distribution for `entity_type = 'building-footprint'`
   in 48021 and 48453 by hour (id-range join, never `LIKE`), and any writer identity the atom
   body or its provenance carries (`writtenBy`, `runId`, `source`, lease id). Paste the query
   and the result.
2. `atoms_writer_lease_v2` rows whose scope covers `(atoms, building-footprint, 48021)` and
   `(atoms, building-footprint, 48453)` with `takenAt` or `heldAt` on 2026-09-06 to 2026-09-08.
3. The factory `runs` table for any run naming footprint or those counties in the window.
4. Cloud Logging in `hauska-prod-497015` and `legacy-design-tools-prod` for 2026-09-07:
   Cloud Run job executions (any job), service request logs that write atoms, and any
   `write-building-footprint-county` string, read with `gcloud logging read` and a bounded
   `--limit`, output as JSON and read by field.
5. Git: `git log --since=2026-09-06 --until=2026-09-08 --all` in hauska-engine for commits
   touching the footprint writer, and the PR that shipped the staged-geometry join, to see
   whether a lane recorded a run in its close (search doc_repo `_inbox/` for 2026-09-07
   closes mentioning footprint; the boundary-envelope atom program of 2026-09-06 to 07 is the
   likely neighbour).

### What the close says

One of three, and only with the evidence pasted: (a) a run record or an execution log that
names the writer, the machine, the lease and the counts; (b) a named writer with no record
(a laptop run under the freeze), in which case the close carries a break-glass row written
after the fact per the freeze decision's own reversal text, naming who ran it, from where,
with what lease, and the operator's acknowledgement; (c) not attributable from any source
listed above, stated as such, with every source read listed, and a recommendation on what
record the next write must leave so this cannot recur.

State the mechanism you believe explains the write and a second mechanism that would produce
the same rows, and why you rejected it.

### Verification, and the falsifier you pre-register

Write down at CP1: *if the atoms' own `createdAt` values do not fall on 2026-09-07, the
premise is wrong and the row closes as a correction to F8's successor, not as an audit.*

The planner runs `node scripts/surface-probe.mjs --rows P-171 --observations <file>`. The
P-171 predicate is observed: `writerNamed` (true only for outcome (a) or (b)), `outcome` (`a`,
`b` or `c`), `recordRef` (the run record id, execution id, or the break-glass row path), with
`observedBy` and `observedAt`.

### Close

`_inbox/<date>_p171-provenance_close.json` per AGENT_CONTRACT §6 plus the OPS-23 four fields.
`leave_behind`: the audit script path, and the gap in logging you found, if any, with the
field the next writer must emit.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-12_p171-provenance_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-12_p171-provenance_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-12_p171-provenance_close.json

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "p171-provenance",
    "planRows": ["P-171"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "..."
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
