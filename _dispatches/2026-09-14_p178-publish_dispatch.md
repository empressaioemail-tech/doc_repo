CANON-PREAMBLE v9e22f2c4
- COTALITY IS EXTINGUISHED — when code hits it (502/OAuth/fallthrough), re-route to county-gis/public-record, NEVER rotate the credential. Regrid also dead.
- DEPLOYS ARE PLANNER-OWNED — the agent deploys and fixes failed deploys; never escalate a deploy to the operator; "failed on X, fixing X".
- NO PRIVILEGED DATA — everything via uniform public-record; any path must work for a no-relationship jurisdiction.
- CTX / national HOLD LIFTED 2026-08-26 for the Factory program (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_program_and_hold_lifts.md`); the Bastrop QA condition is cosmetic and does not gate the data path. NO PRIVILEGED DATA and the Hauska spine rule stand.
- THE FACTORY IS THE ONLY WRITER PATH (OPS-19) — one machine built to the MODEL LAW (`19_the_instrument_contract.md`, `_blueprint/10_model.md`, `_blueprint/20_pipeline.md`, `_blueprint/40_rule_register.md`, `51_ingestion_pipeline_reference.md`, `24_instrument_conformance_program.md`; package `dist/*.d.ts` is the tiebreaker); own repo `hauska-factory`, own Neon store; every publish lands on staging before the identical job runs on production; nothing reaches a serving store except through publish; laptop ingest is FROZEN (`_decisions/2026-08-26_ingest_freeze_and_cloud_loader.md`); OPTION A ruled (`_decisions/2026-08-26_factory_model_law_and_option_a.md`): no new county is written on the old shape and old-shape writes ended permanently 2026-08-27. Every lane has its own registered worktree; never build in another lane's checkout. Row-level status lives in `_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-19.md` and `_state/property/STATE.md`, never here.
- CODE-DONE != CUSTOMER-DONE — a grade is a live probe on the deployed surface across multiple different-data parcels, never a merged PR.
- MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS (operator 2026-09-11) — for setbacks and every dimensional rule, in every city and county, the source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only on equal or unreadable dates; dates are read at source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; an unreadable date produces a conflict row with both values, never a silent pick. Supersedes tier-first ranking in LDT `authoritativeSetbackSource.ts` and layer-23-first in hauska-map. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED (operator 2026-09-11) — Ruling B reversed for the polygon only: map and MCP draw block draw the modelled buildable envelope from the same `place/buildable-envelope` call with its disclosure wherever a district and setback table exist; buildable area and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs them. Entitlement gate unchanged. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH, ATOMS ARE CANONICAL (operator 2026-09-11) — node = identity, atom = one claim from one authority at one time, edge = an atom whose value is a node; a cell is accounting (state, atom reference, provenance, cached rendering keyed to atom version and vocabulary version), never a copied value; one reader in `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms and every surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy; one writer mints atom + pointer + rendering in one transaction; one vocabulary module in the atom-contract package. Never add a read path, a vocabulary copy, or a value-holding cell. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, ADR-031 amendment 2026-09-11, OPS-23 §0.
- Full standing-decisions detail: `MEMORY.md` (auto-memory) + `_decisions/`.

AGENT-CONTRACT v79be86e2 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/AGENT_CONTRACT.md in full (fan model,
interruption recovery, slot law + lease, heavy-scan serialization, verification rules, close schema).
Read it before any work; where this dispatch and the contract disagree, STOP and report.

DEV-PROCESS vbb19bd34 — you are bound by 90_runbooks/DEV_PROCESS.md in full. It governs how work
is SHAPED and how a result is JUDGED: coverage figures travel with their denominator, classes are
measured never subtracted, an instrument's exclusion set is part of its contract, gating indicators are
proven able to fire, paired controls need a divergence test, guardrails that do not survive a clone are
not guardrails. Every rule in it is traced to an incident. Read it before any work.

FLEET-MEMORY v2a98086b — you are bound by 90_runbooks/fleet_memory_practice.md (M0).
The verbatim install block follows. Product-repo agents do not carry .cursor/rules; this is the install.

FLEET MEMORY (M0): As you work, capture build knowledge in a scratch block you return in your close, using four entry kinds — LESSON (a hard-won fact worth a test/note), DEAD-END (a tried-and-failed path + reason, so it is not retried), GROUND-TRUTH (a live-verified state WITH its timestamp), OPEN (a live thread the next context must pick up). Read any scratch context passed to you FIRST before re-deriving. Do NOT promote anything to durable memory yourself — return lessons in your close; the planner gates promotion. Nearing your limit, flush open threads + live ground-truths into your close so the next instance starts warm.

# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-23 surface completion

You are working a lane of OPS-23. Everything below is program law for this lane. If it
conflicts with the general canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it
conflicts with the AGENT CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win. The plan is
`90_operations/OPS-23_surface_completion_program.md`; read sections 2, 3 and 7 before any work.

## The one goal

The Property Explorer panel, the map, the exported PDFs, and the Smart Site MCP connector show
the same facts for the same parcel, from one reader, with honest absences that name the city or
source that is missing. Six Central Texas counties first. **The customer surface is the
predicate.** A merged PR, a cortex read, a ledger count, or an MCP read alone does not close a
lane in this program.

## The five rulings (operator, 2026-09-11) — do not relitigate

- **R-1 MOST-CURRENT SOURCE WINS.** For setbacks and every dimensional rule, everywhere: the
  source with the most recent effective date supplies the value; tier breaks ties only when dates
  are equal or unreadable; dates are read from the source (ordinance effective date, ArcGIS
  `editingInfo.lastEditDate`), never assumed from source kind; unreadable dates produce a conflict
  row with both values, never a silent pick. `_decisions/2026-09-11_setback_source_most_current_wins.md`.
- **R-2 ENVELOPE DRAWN, FIGURE REFUSED.** The map and the MCP draw block draw the modelled
  buildable envelope from the same call with its disclosure wherever a district and a setback
  table exist. The buildable area number and percent stay refused until an envelope atom backs
  them. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ruling_b_reversed_polygon_only.md`.
- **R-3 THE CITY IS THE UNIT.** Zoning and setback work is scoped per city with a per-city
  predicate. Until a city is done, every absence string names the city.
- **R-4 THE SURFACE PROBE IS THE PREDICATE.** Your close cites a `surface-probe` artifact run
  after your deploy (or, until `scripts/surface-probe.mjs` lands, the raw output of the hand
  probes in OPS-23 §2 pasted verbatim) showing your change on the surface you claim to have
  changed.
- **R-5 THREE ROLES.** You are a lane. You do not commit to doc_repo; you hand artifacts back.
  You may fan one level per AGENT_CONTRACT §1 and verification stays with you.
- **R-6 THE LEDGER IS THE SERVING PATH AND ATOMS ARE CANONICAL.** A node is identity; an atom
  is one claim from one authority at one time; an edge is an atom whose value is a node. A cell
  is accounting: state, atom reference, provenance, and a cached rendering keyed to atom
  version and vocabulary version; a cell never holds a value as canon. One reader in
  `hauska-engine/services/retrieval-api` walks gated cells and dereferences atoms; every
  surface and the Hauska MCP catalog consume it; unslated rails refuse, never fall to legacy.
  One writer mints atom, pointer and rendering in one transaction. One vocabulary module in
  the atom-contract package. Never add a seventh read path, a second vocabulary, or a cell
  that copies a value. `_decisions/2026-09-11_ledger_as_serving_path_seven_steps.md`, OPS-23 §0.

## Facts a lane must carry (verified 2026-09-11; re-verify at source before relying)

- The panel reads facets through hauska-map's own adapter (`api/_lib/pe-property-atoms.ts`,
  `atom-chain-to-facets.ts`), `readPath: atom-chain`, not through cortex node-facets. The
  record-served setback cutover lives in LDT `nodeFacetTier1Assemble.ts` /
  `setbacksFactServeCutover.ts` and reaches `get_smart_site`, not the panel.
- The map draws an envelope only through `ExplorerMap.handleEnvelope`, fed by `InspectCard`
  from the sealed sheet (`fact-sheet-resolver.ts`); the card issues no lookup of its own
  (invariant I2). `sheetEnvelopeIsAtomPathPending` (`fact-sheet-resolver.ts:216-241`) is Ruling
  B's mechanism. `handleEnvelope` also gates drawing on `isEntitled` (Pro, unlocked, dev role);
  that gate is not yours to change.
- `resolveGeometry` (`fact-sheet-resolver.ts:2520-2660`) already accepts `hint.centroid`;
  `ExplorerMap.adoptSubject` passes only `{ geometry }`. The live parcel layer
  (`map-data/gis-layer`) returns the ring for a bbox around `cityLimitsFact.queryPoint`.
- cortex geocoding cannot find "414 SPILLER LN" with or without ", WEST LAKE HILLS, TX"
  (422 `geocode_miss` both ways). Placement must not depend on it.
- The feasibility engine (`hauska-engine-api-00198-cir`) completes Travis refreshes in 85 to
  154 s with 201; PE and smartsite-mcp abort at 55 s; the download endpoint serves the finished
  PDF in 0.2 s afterwards.
- Cell-state vocabulary is OPS-21's (`_catalog/program_preambles/OPS-21.md`). Six states. Use no other.

## What a lane in this program must not do

- Do not mint or backfill envelope atoms; that program resumes when P-152 closes.
- Do not change the entitlement gate or any pricing surface.
- Do not fix a naming mismatch by renaming; report it.
- Do not widen a check to admit a value it does not satisfy; report it.
- Do not read a working tree to verify a deploy; read the serving revision by field name and probe the surface.
- Do not write to a repository your seat does not own; request it from the owning seat via the close.

## Close requirements, in addition to AGENT_CONTRACT §6

- `probe:` the artifact path or the pasted raw output, per R-4.
- `falsifier:` the result you pre-registered that would have proved your change wrong, and what you observed.
- `contradicted:` what in the dispatch or the plan was wrong when you got there. "Nothing" is acceptable and must be said.
- `leave_behind:` per ENFORCEMENT.md.


## Mission — P-180 walk fix, then P-178 step 6: excluded nodes carry the current run id, the Hays publish walks, and the seven cards are read

You are the deepest worker in OPS-23 wave 6. You do not spawn sub-agents. The dispatch
planner supervises you, reviews CP1 and CP2, runs `scripts/surface-probe.mjs --rows P-175`
after your publish, and reads the seven cards with its own connector.

Exit-bounded verification: every command you run must terminate on its own; wrap anything that
could hang in `timeout`; never leave a watch, a tail or a dev server running.

### The ruling you execute (A-146, option B)

P-180 (LDT #683) excludes hollow account-keyed nodes from the tier-1 bake's work list in
gate-blocked counties, so they are never rewritten and keep a stale `publishRunId`. The
factory's verify-walk (`verify-walk.mjs:508-511`) requires the CURRENT run id on every parcel
it sweeps, including an earned retirement. Both invariants stay: the bake keeps excluding
hollow nodes from the fact build AND retires them with the current run id in a cheap pass, so
the stamp the walk wants exists. Do not weaken the walk.

### Where you work

`legacy-design-tools-p178-publish` (branch `fix/p180-retire-excluded-with-current-run`) and
`hauska-factory-p178-publish` (branch `chore/p178-pin-and-publish`), from `origin/main`;
declare start commits.

### What is true today (`_inbox/2026-09-14_p178-hays-roll_close.json`; re-verify)

- Production `cad_property` 48209/2026: 134,591 certified rows (`hays_20260826_certified.zip`)
  with identifiers, 390 marked `absent-from-declared-drop` by the loader (LDT #680), vintage
  label mapped (#681). Nothing here changes.
- Staging 48209 tier-1 is MIXED: 116,421 rows at the current bake, 56,629 at the previous.
  Run `factory-bastrop-publish-fwv5s` failed `WALK_FAILED` on 84629 to 84639 (BP-PUBLISH-RUN-01,
  "facets not stamped with publish run") while the gold and its neighbours passed.
- 84629 is not in `txgio_parcel`, already carries an earned retirement (`absent-verified`,
  `lastSeenTaxYear 2025`) from the first run under the old pin, and is excluded under the new
  pin, so its stamp can never refresh. The street sweep catches hollow nodes because they share
  streets with the anchors. This recurs on every Hays republish until fixed.
- The dispatch's gold anchor 135570 is itself a hollow node; use 97658 (the P-178 lane's CP6
  correction).
- Factory pin: `cloudbuild.publish.yaml _LDT_SHA` = `82857ebb` (#146). CI checks the pin.

### What you build, in order

1. **LDT.** In the tier-1 bake, after the fact build, a retirement pass over every node the
   work-list exclusion skipped in a gate-blocked county: write (or refresh) its retirement
   record with the CURRENT `publishRunId` and no facts. A test that fails when an excluded node
   is left with a stale stamp; a test that the fact build still skips it. Merge on the
   conclusion string.
2. **Factory.** Bump `_LDT_SHA` to your merge; CI-required comment; merge. Do not touch the
   walk's rule.
3. **Staging publish** (`factory-bastrop-publish`, county 48209, gold 97658), read the run
   row and the walk verdict; paste the stamp counts: current-run rows must equal 173,050.
4. **Production publish** on the operator's go quoted into the planner's thread (it is a
   serving-store write). Same reads.
5. **Cards.** The planner reads `get_smart_site` at depth node for `48209:97658`, three moved
   accounts (166234, 167545, 28279 by their nodes) and three marked accounts, and pastes
   value, vintage label and disposition. The planner runs `--rows P-175`.

### Falsifiers

- If the staging walk fails BP-PUBLISH-RUN-01 on any node after step 3, the retirement pass
  missed a population; name it.
- If any excluded node serves facts after step 3, the pass wrote more than a retirement.
- If current-run rows on staging differ from 173,050, the work list changed shape; explain it.

### Out of scope

The walk's rule. Williamson (P-184). The record store (P-183).

### Close

`_inbox/<date>_p178-publish_close.json`, `planRows` `["P-180", "P-178"]`, with the PRs and
merge SHAs with conclusion strings, both run ids and walk verdicts, the stamp counts, the
seven reads, and the planner's probe artifact. `leave_behind` is required.

CHECKPOINTS AND CLOSE (exact paths; machine-checkable per contract section 6):
  CP1: _inbox/2026-09-14_p178-publish_cp1.json
  CP2: _inbox/2026-09-14_p178-publish_cp2.json
  CLOSE: _inbox/2026-09-14_p178-publish_close.json
  These paths are relative to the doc_repo worktree the session RUNNING YOU is rooted in: for a
  lane spawned by the dispatch planner that is the planner's worktree; for the dispatch planner
  itself it is its own seat worktree (never P:/doc_repo, the integration seat's checkout). This
  dispatch was compiled in P:/seat-worktrees/dispatch-planner/doc_repo. Two lanes in each of waves 1 and 2 wrote
  into the property seat's worktree instead and their artifacts had to be found by hand.
  No notification arrives when a background command finishes: poll with a bounded loop and a
  timeout; a lane that ends its turn waiting for a wake-up stalls (two lanes did, wave 2).

CLOSE SKELETON (the fields the enforcement gate reads; spell them exactly, or the gate refuses
the commit rather than guessing what you meant):
  {
    "lane": "p178-publish",
    "planRows": ["P-180", "P-178"],
    "status": "closed | closed-partial | blocked",
    "probe": { "artifact": "_inbox/<date>_<HHMMSS>_surface_probe.json" },
    "falsifier": "...", "contradicted": "...", "leave_behind": [...],
    "missionPremise": "...", "completionPredicate": "...", "scopeBasis": "..."
  }
  A close that says "closed" must be PASS for every parcel of every row in planRows on the cited
  artifact. A close that says "closed-partial" or "blocked" must still cite an artifact that
  measured its rows; the verdicts may be FAIL or UNMEASURED. planRows is an array, never a
  string; probe.artifact is a path under _inbox/ produced by scripts/surface-probe.mjs.
