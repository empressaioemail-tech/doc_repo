# PROGRAM CONTEXT — OPS-21 serve completion

You are working a lane of OPS-21. Everything below is program law for this lane. If it
conflicts with the general canon preamble, this section is narrower and wins on scope; if it
conflicts with the AGENT CONTRACT or ENFORCEMENT, those win.

## The one goal

Every one of the 65 parcel-record rails reaches a real state with an instrument behind it, in
production, for the six Central Texas counties. **Not "acquire everything."** Values where we
have data, honest dispositions where we do not.

Counties: `48021` Bastrop, `48055` Caldwell, `48209` Hays, `48309` McLennan, `48453` Travis,
`48491` Williamson.

## The six cell states — this is the vocabulary, use no other

| state | means | requires |
|---|---|---|
| `value` | measured | instrument, scope, measuredAt |
| `absent-verified` | something looked and it is not there | a NAMED instrument and an explicit SCOPE |
| `not-applicable` | a ruling says this does not govern here | a decision-record pointer |
| `refused` | a real value exists upstream and the source cannot say which | instrument, scope |
| `unaccounted` | nobody has looked | nothing — it is the default |
| `available-on-request` | not acquired in bulk; fetched per parcel on demand. Nobody has asked for this one | a named, REACHABLE `requestPath` |

**`available-on-request` is NOT an absence claim.** It says nothing about whether the fact
exists. A `requestPath` that is not reachable is not this state — a dead path makes the cell
`unaccounted` or `refused`, never a promise the product cannot keep. Adding a rail to this
state is a ruling, never a lane's discretion. Ruled 2026-09-10.

**`unaccounted` is legitimate at rest and fatal at publish.** Both halves are load-bearing. If
it stops being fatal it becomes cover; if it stops being legitimate the pressure moves to
fabricating values.

**Never convert `unaccounted` to `absent-verified` to clear a gate.** `absent-verified` is a
claim that something looked. Writing it where nothing looked is a lie that passes every check.
A relabelling tripwire counts unaccounted falling without a matching acquisition landing.

**Where a real limit exists and the source cannot say which, the state is `refused`, not
`not-applicable`.** Default to the weaker state. `not-applicable` on an in-city parcel claims
the land is unzoned.

## Identity — get this wrong and every cell is wrong

```
place_key      "{county_fips}:{prop_id}"              RAW. This is what cells are keyed on.
parcelNodeId   "{county_fips}:{normalizeForJoin(prop_id)}"   NORMALIZED (engine side).
entity_id      "{parcelNodeId}:{suffix}"              atoms only.
```

`normalizeForJoin` strips leading zeros on all-digit tokens. **Write cells on the RAW
`place_key`. Do not normalize.** The divergence between the two is a known, unmeasured
conflation risk; do not widen it.

A parcel is not an account. `parcel_record`'s intended population is
`landing_parcel_jurisdiction`, not the `cad_property` account roll. N polygons can share one
`prop_id` and are folded to one atom by design.

## Stores

```
neondb      txgio_parcel, cad_property, parcel_record, parcel_record_cell,
            parcel_record_companion_row, parcel_gate_verdict,
            landing_parcel_jurisdiction, tx_* layers, permit_record
hauska_mcp  atoms
```

**Two databases on one Neon host. A SQL join across them cannot be written at all.** A query
against the wrong database returns a FALSE ABSENCE, not an error. Declare which store you
opened.

## Grading is not serving

`publish-gate-sched` writes verdicts to `parcel_gate_verdict`. `parcelRecordAllowlist.ts`
(LDT) requires BOTH code-owned slate membership AND a `pass` verdict before a rail serves from
the record, and the slate is **never** auto-derived from a passing verdict. Widening what is
graded changes nothing a customer sees. Do not conflate the two controls.

## Jurisdiction

`landing_parcel_jurisdiction.disposition` is three values: `unincorporated`, `in-city`,
`unresolved`. **ETJ is not one of them** — `etjStatus` is a separate rail.

`UNINCORPORATED_NOT_APPLICABLE_RAIL_KEYS` already writes `not-applicable` on 18 rails at row
creation for unincorporated parcels. **Do not touch those cells.** Most zoning-envelope work
is in-city only, which is a much smaller population than the county count suggests.

The six counties hold 69 cities; 23 carry a zoning layer endpoint. Two binding methods are in
play (`covers-v1`, `intersection-v1`) and must never be averaged across versions.

## The defect class this program exists to close

**Vacuous write paths.** Dormant means no trigger. Starved means a trigger and correct logic
with an input never supplied. **Vacuous means it runs perfectly, every test passes, and it
cannot succeed on any branch.** Nothing in this fleet detects the third.

The instance: `computeTier1Envelope` (LDT `nodeFacetBakeTier1.ts:92`) has two return branches
and both are `status:"declined"`. Six weeks of "setbacks keep coming up short" is that one
function. Before reporting a rail blocked on data, read its write path and check whether a
value is reachable at all.

## Hard prohibitions

- **Bastrop MyGov is off limits.** `smartcity-os` `tenant_id=2` carries 658 active permits and
  full inspection, violation and work-order data. It is a city customer's internal feed.
  Tenant sovereignty and NO PRIVILEGED DATA both forbid it populating a public parcel rail.
  The join will look like free coverage. It is not.
- **Do not hand-author a rail list.** The closed set is
  `src/lib/parcel-record-engine/rail-keys.js`, 65 rails, derived not hand-authored. A
  hand-maintained denominator is the defect class this program exists to close.
- **Do not lift `SETBACK_APPLY_HELD`** or route through the setback atom writer. Out of scope
  by operator decision; cells are written from the ruled table.
- **Stay in your own repository.** Read across repos freely; write only where your lane says.

## Completion is a predicate, not a close file

Your lane's row in OPS-21 carries a completion predicate that is a query, not a paragraph.
`node scripts/plan-progress.mjs --sql` in doc_repo prints them. **A lane is done when its
predicate says so.** Reporting done against any other instrument is the failure this program
was opened to fix — the publish gate graded 17 of 65 rails, so an agent could honestly pass a
question nobody asked.

State your snapshot: repository, branch, commit. Verify by violation before reporting any
check as working.
